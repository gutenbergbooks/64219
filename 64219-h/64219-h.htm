<h3><span class="smcap lsp2">Part I.</span></h3>

<p>Jockey. Hey Maggy, wilt thou stay and tak kent fouks
hame wi’ ye the night?</p>

<p>Maggy. Wiltu come awa than Johny. I fain wad be hame
or the ky come in, our meikle Riggy is sic a rumbling royte,
she rins ay thro’ the byre, and sticks a’ the bits a couties; my
mither is nae able to had her up to her ain stake.</p>

<p>Jockey. Hute, we’ll be hame in bra’ time woman: and
how’s a’ your fouks at hame?</p>

<p>Maggy. Indeed I canna well tell you man, our guidame is
a’ gane wi’ the gut; my mither is very frail, my father he’s ay
wandering about, and widdling amang the beasts.</p>

<p>Jockey. But dear Maggy they tell me we’re gawn to get a
wedding of thee and Andrew Merrymouth the laird’s gardener.</p>

<p>Maggy. Na, na, he maun hae a brawer lass to be his wife
than the like o’ me, but auld Tammy Tailtrees was seeking
me, my father wad a haen me to tak him, but my mither
wadna let, there was an odd debate about it, my guidame wad
a sticket my mither wi’ the grape, if my father hadna chanc’d
to founder her wi’ the beetle.</p>

<p>Jockey. Hech woman, I think your father was a fool for
fashing wi’ him, auld slavery dufe, he wants naething of a cow
but the clutes, your guidame may tak him hersel, twa auld
tottering stumps, the tane may sair the tither fu’ well.</p>

<p>Maggy. Ach man! I wad a tane thee or ony body to hane
them greed again, my father bled my guidame’s nose, and my
guidame brake my mithers thumb; the neighbours came
a’ rinning in, but I had the luck to haud my father’s hands till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
yence my guidame plotted him wi’ the broe that was to mak
our brose.</p>

<p>Jockey. Dear Maggy, I hae something to tell you an ye
wadna be angry at it?</p>

<p>Maggy. O Johnny, there’s my hand I’se no be angry at it,
be what it will.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
[Shakes hands for fear of an outcast.]<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>Jockey. Indeed Maggy the fouk of your town and the fouk
of our town, says, we are gawn to be married: What say’st
thou?</p>

<p>Maggy. I wish we ne’er do war, O Johny, I dream’d o’
you lang syne, an I liket you ay after that.</p>

<p>Jockey. O Maggy! Maggy! dost thou mind since I came
to your mither’s bill, wi’ my mither’s cow, ye ken she wadna
stand, and ye helped me to haud her; ay after that they scorned
me that I wad be married on a you.</p>

<p>Maggy. It’s very true man, it’ll be an odd thing an it be;
but it’s no fa’ back at my door, I assure ye.</p>

<p>Jockey. Nor at mine, but my mither bad me kiss ye.</p>

<p>Maggy. Indeed sall ye Johny, thou’s no want twa kisses
man, ane on every side o’ the mouth, man.</p>

<p>Jockey. Ha! ha! Maggy, I’ll hae a merry night o’ kissing
you shortly.</p>

<p>Maggy. Ay but Johny, you maun stay till that night come:
it’s best to keep the feast until the feast day.</p>

<p>Jockey. Dinna be angry Maggy, my wife to be, but I have
heard my mither saying in her daffing that fouk sud ay try gin
their house will haud their plenishin.</p>

<p>Maggy. Ay but Johny, a wife is ae thing, an a house
anither, a man that’s a mind to marry a woman he’ll no mak
her a whore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Jockey. It’s a’ true Maggy, but fouks may do it yence or
they be married and no hae nae ill in their minds.</p>

<p>Maggy. Aha Johny, mony a are has been beguil’d wi’
yence, and do it yence ye may do it ay, what an we get a bystart,
and hae to suffer for the foul act of fornication.</p>

<p>Jockey. Ay but my mither says, if I dinna get thee wi’
bairn, I’ll no get thee; so it’s the surest way of wooing.</p>

<p>Maggy. Indeed Johny I like you better nor ony lad I see,
and I sall marry you an yence my father’s muck were out, my
mither downa wirk at the midden.</p>

<p>Jockey. A Maggy, Maggy, I’m fear’d ye beguile me, an
then my mither will murder me for being so silly.</p>

<p>Maggy. My jo Jockey, tell your mither to provide a’ things
for the bridal, and I sal marry you in three uks after this, but
we maun gie in siller to the Precentor, a groat an a drink to
the bellman, and then the Kirk wa’s maun hear o’t, three sunday’s
or it come.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Jockey. But Maggy am no to make a blin bargain wi’ you
nor nae body, I maun ken o’ your things an ye sall ken o’
mine.</p>

<p>Maggy. I ken well what I was to get, an gin my mither
like the bargain well, she’ll make it better; but an my father
be angry at the match, I darna meet you to be married.</p>

<p>Jockey. I see na how he can be angry. I wat well I’m a
gay sturdy fallow, when I laid on a bow and five pecks o’ bear
on the laird’s Bawsey, an he’s as bilchy a beast as in a’ the
barronry.</p>

<p>Maggy. Ay but my mither is aye angry at ony body that
evens themselves to me, an it binna them she likes, indeed she
bad me tak ony body if it were na auld tottering Tammie,
for his beard is ay brown wi’ sucking tobacco, and slavers a’
the breast o’ his fecket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Jockey. O! Maggy tak me an I’ll tell you what I hae;
first my father left me when he died, fifty merks, twa sacks,
twa pair of sunks, the hens, an the gawn gear was to be divided
between me and my mither, and if she died first, a’ her gear
was to come amang mine, and if I died before her, a’ my gear
was to come back to her again, an her to marry anither man
if she cou’d get him. But since it’s happened sae, she is to gie
me Brucky an the black mare, the haf o’ the cogs, three spoons,
four pair o’ blankets an a can’as, she’s to big a twa bey to her
ain gavel to be a dwelling house to me an my wife, am to get
the wee byre at the end o’ the raw to haud my cow and twa
couties; the haf o’ the barn an a bed o’ the kailyard as lang
as she lives, an when she dies am to pay the earding o’ her
honestly, and a’ the o’ercome is to be my ain: an by that time
I’ll be as rich as e’er my father was before me.</p>

<p>Maggy. Truly Johny, I’se no say meikle to the contrair,
but an ye hae a mind to tak me wi’ what I hae, tell me either
now or never, for I’se be married or lang gae.</p>

<p>Jockey. I wat weel I am courting in earnest, tell me what
you hae, an we’ll say nae mair but marry ither.</p>

<p>Maggy. I’se tell you a’ I ken o’, whate’er my guidame gies
ye’s get it.</p>

<p>Jockey. That’s right, I want nae mair, it’s an unko thing
to marry a naket woman and get naething but twa bair legs.</p>

<p>Maggy. O Johny ye’re ay in the right o’t, for mony ane is
beguil’d and gets naething, but my father is to gie me forty
pund Scots, that night I am married, a lade of meal, a furlet
of groats, auld Crummie is mine since she was a cauf, and now
she has a stirk will tak the bill e’er beltan yet, I hae twa stane
o’ good lint, and three pockfu’s o’ tow a good cauf bed, twa
bowsters and three cods, with three pair o’ blankets, an’ a
covering; forby twa pair to spin, but my mither wadna gie me
crish to them, an ye ken the butter is dear now.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Jockey. Then farewel the night Maggy; the best o’ friends
maun part, and so maun thy twa legs yet.</p>

<p>Maggy. I wish you well, Johny, but sae nae mair till we be
married, and then lad.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
Hame gaed Maggy and tell’d her Mither.
</p>

<p>Mag. O mither! I hae something to tell ye, but ye mauna
tell my father.</p>

<p>Mither. Dear Maggy an what is that!</p>

<p>Mag. Deed Mither, am gawn to be married an’ the muck
were out.</p>

<p>Mith. Dear Maggy an wha’s thou gawn to get, it’s no
auld bubly Tammy.</p>

<p>Mag. Na, na, he’s a bra young man, and has mair gear
nor ilka body kens o’, guess an I’ll tell you, it’s Johny Bell,
and his mither sent him to the market just to court me.</p>

<p>Mith. Deed Maggy ye’ll no be ill youket wi’ him, he’s a
gay we’ll gawn fallow, right spruch, amaist like an ill-far’d gentleman.
Hey guidman, do ye hear that our Maggy is gawn
to be married an the muck were out.</p>

<p>Father. Na, na, I’ll no allow that until the peats be cussen
and hurl’d.</p>

<p>Mag. O father it’s dangerous to delay the like o’ that, I
like him, an he likes me, it’s best to strike the iron whan it’s
het.</p>

<p>Fath. An wha is she gawn to get guidwife?</p>

<p>Mith. An wha think ye guidman?</p>

<p>Fath. A what wat I herie, an she please hersel, am pleas’d
already.</p>

<p>Mith. Indeed she’s gawn to get Johny Bell, as cliver a
little fallow, as in a the barronry where he bides.</p>

<p>Fath. A well, a well herie, she’s yours as well as mine, gie
her to wha ye please.</p>

<p>Mith. A well Maggy, I’se hae a’ things ready, an I’ll hae
thee married or this month be done.</p>

<p>Mag. Thanks to ye Mither, mony a good turn ye done
me, an this will be the best, I think.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
Hame gaed Jockey to his mither, crying.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Jock. Mither! Mither! I made it out, her mouth is sweeter
na milk, my heart plays a whiltie whaltie whan I kiss her.</p>

<p>Mith. Fair fa’ thee my son Johny, thou’s gotten the geat
o’t at last, and whan is thou gawn to be married?</p>

<p>Jock. Whan I like mither, but get the masons the morn,
to big me my house, for I’ll hae a’ my things in right good
order.</p>

<p>Mith. Thou’s want for naething, my bairn, but pusht forward
as fast as ye can.</p>

<p>The wooing being o’er and the day being set, Jockey’s
mither killed the black boul horn’d yeal Ewe, that lost her
lamb the last year, three hens and a gule fitted cock, to prevent
the ripples, five pecks o’ maut masket in the meikle kirn,
a pint o’ trykle to mak it thicker an sweeter an maumier for
the mouth; five pints o’ whisky wherein was garlic and spice,
for raising o’ the wind, an the clearing o’ their water; the
friends and good neighbours went a’ wi’ John to the kirk,
where Maggy chanced to meet him and was married by the
minister; the twa companies joined togither and came hame
in a croud, at every change house they chanced to pass by,
providence stopt their proceeding, with full stoups, bottles and
glasses drinking their healths, wishing them much joy, ten
girls and a boy: Jockey seeing so many wishing well to his
health, coupt up what he got, for to augment his health and
gar him live long, which afterwards coupt up him and proved
detrimental to the same.</p>

<p>So home they came to the dinner, where his mother presented
to them a piping het haggies, made of the creish of the
black boul horn’d Ewe, boil’d in the meikle bag, mixt with
bear meal, onions, spice and mint: this haggis being supt
warm, the foaming swats and spice in the liquor set John’s
belly a bizin like a working fat, and he playing het fit to the
fidler, was suddenly seized with a bocking and rebounding,
gave his dinner such a backward ca that he lost a’ but the
grit bits scythed through his teeth; his mother cried to spence
him, and bed him wi’ the bride, his breeks being fill’d, they
washed both his hips, laid him in his bed, pale and ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
was his face, and closed were baith his een, ah, cries his mither,
a dismal day indeed, his brithal and his burial may baith
be on ae day: some cuist water in his face, and jagg’d him
wi’ a needle; till he began to rouze himself up, and rap out
broken words, mither, mither, whar am I now? Whar are ye
my bairn says his mither, ye’re beddet, and I’ll bring the
bride to you. Beddet, and is my brithel done ells? Ay, said
she, here’s the bride come to ly down wi’ you: na, na, said he,
I’ll no ly wi that unco woman indeed, if it binna heeds and
thraws, the way that I lay wi’ my mither; O fy dinna affront
yoursel. The bride faus a crying. O mither, mither, was
this the way my father guided you the first night? Na, na,
thy father was a man o’ manners and better mettle, poor thing
Meg, thou’s caud thy hogs to a bonny market. A bonny
market, says his mither, a shame fa you and her baith, he’s
worthy o’ her tho’ she were better nor what she is, or e’er will
be. His friends an her friends being a mixt multitude, some
took his part some took her’s, there a battle began in the clap
of a hand, being a very fierce tumult which ended in blood,
they struck so hard with stones, sticks, beetles, and barrow
trams, pigs, pots, stoups, trunchers, were flying like bombs and
granades.</p>

<p>The crook, bouls and tongs were all employed as weapons
of war: till down came the bed with a great mou of peats. So
this disturbed the treading.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="p2 center">THE WONDERFUL WORKS OF OUR JOHN.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part II.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Now though all the ceremonies of Jockey and Maggy’s
wedding were ended, when they were fairly bedded before a
wheen rattling unruly witnesses, who dang down the bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
aboon them; the battle still encreased, and John’s works
turned out to be very wonderful; for he made Janet, that was
his mither’s lass the last year, grow like an Elshin shaft, and
got his Maggy wi’ bairn forby.</p>

<p>The hamsheughs were very great until auld uncle Rabby
came into redd them, and a sturdy auld fallow he was, stood
stively wi’ a stiff rumple, and by strength of his arms rave
them sindry, flingin the tane east and the tither west, until
they stood a round about like as many breathless forfoughen
cocks, and no ane durst steer anither for him, Jockey’s
mither was driven o’re a kist, and brogget a her hips on a
round heckle, up she gat and rinning to fell Maggy’s mither
wi’ the ladle, swearing she was the mither of a’ the mischief
that happened, uncle Rabby ran in between them, he having
a great lang nose like a trumpet, she recklessly came o’er his
lobster neb a drive wi’ the ladle until the blood sprang out and
ran down his auld grey beard and hang like snuffy bubbles at
it; O! then he gaed wood, and looked as waefu like, as he
had been a tod lowrie, com’d frae worrying lambs, wi’ his
bloody mouth. Wi’ that he gets an auld flail, and rives away
the supple, then drives them a to the back o’ the door,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'but but yet nane'">
but yet nane</ins> wan out; than wi’ chirten and chappen, down
comes the clay hallen and the hen bauk with Rab Reid the
fidler, who had crept up aside the hens for the preservation of
his fiddle.</p>

<p>Ben comes the bride when she got on her coat, clappet
Rabby’s shoulder and bad him spare their lives: for their is
blood enough shed in ae night, quoth she, and that my beard
can witness, quoth he. So they a’ came in obedience to uncle
Rabby, for his supple made their pows baith saft and sair that
night; but daft Maggy Simson sat by the fire and picket
banes a’ the time o’ the battle: indeed quoth she, I think
ye’re a’ fools but mysel; for I came here to get a guid supper,
and other fouk has gotten their skin we’ll pait.</p>

<p>By this time up got John the bridegroom, that was Jockey
before he was married, but could na get his breeks; yet wi’ a
horse nail he tacket his sark tail between his legs, that nane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
might see what every body should hide, and rambling he cries
settle ye, or I’ll gar my uncle settle ye, and saften ye’re heads
wi’ my auld supple.</p>

<p>Poor Rab Reid the fidler took a sudden blast; some said
he was maw-turn’d wi’ the fa’; for he bocked up a the barley
and then gar’d the ale go like a rain bow frae him as brown
as wort brose.</p>

<p>The hurly burly being ended, and naething but fair words
and shaking o’ hands, which was a sure sign o’ an agreement,
they began to cow their cuttet lugs, and wash their sairs, a
but Jockey’s mither, who cries out a black end on a you and
your wedding baith: for I hae gotten a hunder holes dung in
my arse wi’ the heckle teeth.</p>

<p>Jockey answers, A e’en had you wi’ them than mither, ye
will een be better sair’d.</p>

<p>Up gets uncle Rabby, and auld Sandy the sutor o’ Seggyhole,
and put every thing in order; they prappet up the bed
wi’ a rake and rippling kame, the bearers being broken, they
made a solid foundation of peats, laid on the cauf bed and
bowsters, where Jockey and Maggy was beddet the second time.</p>

<p>Jockey no being used to lie wi’ a naked woman, except
heads and thraws wi’ his mither, gets his twa hands about the
brides neck and his houghs out o’er her hurdies, saying, I
ne’er kist wife nor lass naked before, and for fainness I’ll bite
you, I’ll bite you, &amp;c. Naithing mair remarkable till about
haf a year and four ukes thereafter, in comes Marion Mushet
rinning barefoot and bare legget, wi’ bleart cheeks and a watery
nose, cursing and banning, greeting and flyting.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
Marion enters. Crying, and whar’s John.
</p>

<p>His mither answers. Indeed he’s out in the yard powing
Kail runts.</p>

<p>Marion. A black end on a him and his runts baith, for he’s
ruin’d me and my bairn.</p>

<p>Mith. Ruin’d you! it canna be; he never did you ill, nor
said you ill, be night or be day, what gars you say that?</p>

<p>Mar. O woman! our Jenny is a’ rowing like a pack o’ woo;
indeed she’s wi’ quick bairn, and your John is the father o’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Mith. Our John the father o’t! had, there enough said,
lying lown, I trow our John was ne’er guilty of sic a sinfu
action: Daft woman, I true it ill be but wind that hoves up
the lasses wame; she’ll hae drunken some sour drink like sour
sowens, or rotten milk that mak’s her sae.</p>

<p>Mar. A wae be to him and his actions baith, he’s the
father o’t furnicator dog that he’s, he’s ruin’d me and my
bairn; I bore her and brought her up honestly, till she came,
to you; her father died and left me wi’ four o’ them, there
wasna ane o’ them cou’d pit on anither’s claes, or tak a louse
aff ither.</p>

<p>Mith. I bid you had your tongue, and no even your bystarts
to my bairn, for he’ll ne’er tak wi’t: he, poor silly lad, he
wad ne’er look to a lass, be’s to lay her down. Fy Maggy cry
in o’ John, and let’s ratify’t wi’ the auld ruddoch: ay, ye’ere no
blate for saying sae.</p>

<p>Mar. Be angry, or be well pleased, I’ll say’t in a your faces,
an I’ll ca you before your betters about it or lang gae.</p>

<p>John enters. An what want ye now, is our brose ready yet?</p>

<p>Mith. Ay brose, black brose indeed for thee, my bairn;
here Marion Mushet saying ye hae gotten her dochter wi’ bairn.</p>

<p>Jock. Me mither? I ne’er lay in a bed wi’ her dochter a
my days, it’ll be the young lairds, for a saw him kiss her at
the Lammas fair, an let glam at her nonsense.</p>

<p>Mith. Ay, ay, my man Johny, that’s the way she has gotten
her belly fu’ o’ bairns; it’s no you nor the like o’ you, poor
innocent lad, that gets bystart weans: a wheen filthy lowns,
every ane loups on anither, and gies you the wyte o’ a’.</p>

<p>Mar. You may say what you like about it, it’s easy to ca’
a court whar there’s nae body to say again, but I’ll tell you
a I ken about it, and that is what she tell’t me, and you guidwife
telt me some o’t yoursel; an gin you hadna brought in
Maggy wi’ her muckle tocher atween the twa, your Jockey and
my Jenny had a been man and wife the day.</p>

<p>Jock. I wat weel that’s true.</p>

<p>Mith. Ye filthy dog at ye are, are ye gaun to confess wi’ a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
bystart; and it no yours: dinna I ken as well as she do wha’s
aught it?</p>

<p>Jock. Ay but mither, we may deny as we like about it, but
I doubt it come to my door at last.</p>

<p>Mith. Ye silly sumff and senseless fallow, had ye been
knuckle deep wi’ the dirty drab, ye might a said sae, but ye
telt me lang syne that ye cou’d na lo’e her, she was so lazy
and lown like; besides her crooket fit and bow’d legs.</p>

<p>Jock. Ay but mither, do ye mind since ye sent me out to
gie her the parting kiss, at the black hole o’ the peet stack;
she rave the button frae my breeks, and wad gar me do’t; and
bad me do’t, and cou’d flesh and blood refuse to do’t; I’m
sure mither, I cou’d ne’er get her wi’ bairn an my breeks on.</p>

<p>Mith. Na, na, poor simple silly lad, the wean’s no yours,
ilk ane loups on of anither, and you’ll get the wyte o’ a bytarts
round about.</p>

<p>Up gets Maggy wi’ a rore, and rives her hair, cries her back,
belly, and baith her sides; the weed and gut gaes thro’ my
flesh like lang needles, nails or elshin irons. Wae be ti’ the
day that e’er I saw his face, I had better married a tinkler, or
a followed the sogers, as mony an honest man’s dochter has
done, and liv’d a better life than I do.</p>

<p>Up gets Jockey and rins o’er the rigs, for John Roger’s wife,
auld Katty the howdy, but or he wan back she parted wi’
patrick thro’ perfect spite, and then lay twa fauld o’er a stool
in a swoon.</p>

<p>Jock. A well, a well, sirs, since my first born is dead without
seeing the light o’ the warld; ye’s a get bread an cheese
to the blyth meat, the thing we shou’d a war’d on the banket
will sair the burial, and that will ay be some advantage: an
Maggy should die, I maun een tak Jenny, the tane is as far a
length as the tither: I’se be furnisht wi’ a wife between the twa.</p>

<p>But Maggy turn’d better the next day, and was able to
muck the byre; yet there gead sic a tittle tattling thro’ the
town every auld wife tell’t anither o’t, and a’ the light hippet
hussies that rins between towns at een, tugging at their tow
rocks, spread it round the kintry; and every body’s mouth was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
filled wi’ Jockey and Jenny, and how Maggy had parted wi’
bairn.</p>

<p>At last Mess John Hill hears of the horrid action, and sends
the elder of that quarter and Clinkem Bell<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the grave maker,
to summon Jockey and Jenny to the session, and to see how
the stool of repentance wad set them,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> no sooner had they entered
the door but Maggy fa’s a greeting, and wringing her
hands; Jockey’s mither fell a fliting, and he himself a rubbing
his lugs, and riving his hair, saying, O gin I were but a half
ell higher, I sud be a soger or it be lang, and gie me a good
flail or a corn fork, I sud kill Frenchman enew, before I gaed
to face yon flyting ministers, an be set up like a warlds wonder,
on their cock-stool or black stool<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> an wha can bide the shame,
whan every body looks to them, wi’ their sacken sarks or
gowns on them,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> like a piece of an auld canvass prickt about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
a body, for naething, but what every body does amaist, or
they be married as well as me.</p>

<p>Mith. My man Johny, ye’re no the first that has done
it, an ye’ll no be the last; een mony o’ the ministers has
done it themselves, hout ay, your father and I did it mony a
time.</p>

<p>Mag. Ay, ay, and that gars your son be so good o’t as he
is: the thing that is bred in the flesh is ill to pit out o’ the
bane.</p>

<p>Mith. Daft woman what way could the warld stand, if
fouks wadna make use o’ ither, it’s the thing that’s natural,
bairns getting, therefore it’s no to be scunnert at.</p>

<p>Mag. Ay, ay, but an they be for the like o’ that, they
should marry.</p>

<p>Mith. But I think there’s little ill tho’ they try it yence or
twice or they be married; it’s an unco thing till a body to be
bound to a business, if they dinna ken whether they be able
for it or no.</p>

<p>Mag. Ay, ay, that’s your way o’ doing and his, but its no
the way o’ ither honest fouk; see what the minister will say
to it.</p>

<p>Mith. The minister is but a mortal man, and there’s defections
in his members as well as mine.</p>

<p>Mag. Ay, but fouk should ay strive to mortify their members.</p>

<p>Mith. An is that your Whigry? Will you or any body
else, wi’ your mortifying o’ your members, prevent what’s to
come to pass? I wish I saw the minister an his elders, but
I’se gie him scripture for a he’s done yet: tell na me about
the mortifying o’ members, gin he hae gotten a bystart let her
and him feed it between them an they sud gie’t soup about:
but she maun keep it the first quarter, an be that time muckle
black lady ’ill be cauft, we sall sell the cauf an foster the wean
on the cow’s milk: That’s better mense for a fault, than a’
your mortifying o’ your members, and a’ your repenting-stools;
a wheen papist rites an rotten ceremonies, fashing fouks wi’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
sack gowns and buttock-males,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> an I dinna ken what, but bide

<h3><span class="smcap">Part III.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Now Jockey and his mither went into the little byre, and
held a private meeting, nane present but auld bruckie, and the
two brutes the bits a couties.</p>

<p>Mith. Ye silly dog, an he be drown’d to you, how cou’d ye
confess sae muckle to maeslie shanket Marion, altho’ she be
her mither.</p>

<p>Jock. O mither, mither, say nae mair about it, my ain
wand has dung me dourly; sadly have I suffered for that, and
ye ken a’ the misery’s com’d o’er our Maggy, my mouth’s the
mither o’t, sae ha’d your tongue I tell you now.</p>

<p>Mith. An tell ye me to ha’d my tongue, an ye had a
hauden your tongue and your tail, an a done as I bade you,
ye hadna hane sae muckle ado the day daft silly dog it
thou is.</p>

<p>Jock. Mither, mither, gies nane o’ your mocks nor malice,
for tho’ I got the wean, ye hae as muckle the wyte o’t as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Gae seek me out my three new sarks, an Sunday’s shune, an
I’se gae whar ne’er man saw my face before, neither wood,
water nor wilderness, sall haud me again.</p>

<p>Mith. My braw man Johny, ye mauna do that, stay at
hame wi’ me, and set a stout heart till a stay brae, I’se gae to
the session wi’ you, gang whan ye like.</p>

<p>Jock. A well mither, I sall do your bidden for ance yet,
but whan the minister flytes on me, answer ye him, for I
canna speak well again.</p>

<p>Mith. Say nae mair, I hae a pokfu’ o’ perfect petitions to
louse an put to him an his elders, and if thou maun gae to
their black-stool, it’s no be thy lane sall sit upon’t.</p>

<p>Jock. But mither, whether will I deny the doing o’t or
confess the game was at the getting o’t?</p>

<p>Mith. Ay, ay, confess ye did it, but say but ance, and that
it was on the terms of marriage, the way that a’ our kintry
bystarts is gotten.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Now Jockey being three times summon’d to the session and
did not appear, the session insisted for a warrant from the justice
of the peace,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which was readily granted, more for diversion
than justice’ sake, the warrant being given to John King
the constable, who went away with Clinkem Bell on Saturday’s
morning, and catch’d John just at his breakfast, hauls him
awa, ane at ilka oxter like twa butcher dogs hinging at a bull’s
beard, his mother followed, driving him up with good counsels,
my bra’ man Johny, haud up your head, dinna think
shame, for a’ your fauts is but perfect honey, you’re neither a
thief, whore nor horse stealer.</p>

<p>Then Maggy ran for uncle Rabby, an uncle Rabby sent to
Sandy the Souter of Seggyhole, the Souter saddled his mare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and uncle Rabby got aff at the gallop on his gray powney
west the hags, an o’er by Whitehill shough, the nearest, and
was at Sir James the justices lang or John was brought into
judgment.</p>

<p>John enters, before the justice, with a red, red face, Goode’en
Mr. Justice, Sir James, an’t please your honour ye manna put
me in prison, for am no malefactor, but a poor honest kintry-man,
that was born in an ill planet, my mither says’t I had the
ill luck of a misfortune to fa’ foul wi’ furnication, and got my
mither’s lass wi’ bairn the last year, and they’re gawn to father’t
on me the year again.</p>

<p>The justice smiling, answer’d, indeed John I think it is but
very just and reasonable that ye be accountable this year for
your last years labours.</p>

<p>Jock. Ay, ay, sir, I have laboured very sair since my father
died, but our plough canna get gaun for frost this four days.</p>

<p>Just. Ay but John, that’s no what I mean, it’s the child ye
got last year, ye must be answerable for this.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed stir, there was twa o’ them, but there is ane
o’ them dead.</p>

<p>Just. A well then John you’ll have the more to give the one
that’s alive.</p>

<p>Jock. Oh! but stir, it’s my ain wean that’s dead, the ane I
got wi’ my wife; I dinna ken whither the tither be mine or no.</p>

<p>Just. Yours or no sir, when ye told me ye got it; if ye
should get it wi’ a beggar wife at the back of a dike what is
that to the purpose, when it is of your getting you must maintain
it.</p>

<p>Jock. O! yes stir, am no refusing to gie meat and meal to
maintain’t; but my mither winna let me to the black-stool.</p>

<p>Just. Why not go to the black-stool, when guilty of such
an action as deserves it, if you have any reasons why you
should not go, argument it in session and clear yourself if you
can.</p>

<p>John’s mother enters, and addresses herself to the servant
lass, thinking she was the justice’s lady.</p>

<p>Indeed mistress madam, if ye were a kintry good-wife, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
mysel, I could tell you a’ about it, but you that’s gentiles, I
canna use freedom wi you, cause I hae na Latin. But waes
me we that’s poor fouk is born to mony fealins and backwart
faus, this lad is my son, an am his mither, he has had the foul
fortune to get a bystart bairn, nae doubt but we hae been a’
guilty o’ as muckle and ne’er a word about it, a what say ye
madam?</p>

<p>Off goes the lass, saying, Foul fa’ the wife, for I was never
guilty o’t.</p>

<p>Just. Well goodwife, what is the reason but ye let your son
give satisfaction to the kirk?</p>

<p>Mith. Deed stir, he’s no denying the bairn, but he’ll no
hae the black-stool.</p>

<p>Just. Ay, but I tell you, them that gets a bystart, gets the
black-stool to the bargain, and as he is in my hands now, he
must find caution that he will answer the session and be
subject to the law.</p>

<p>Mith. Ony thing ye like, stir, but that shamfu’ stance, the
black stool, here’s uncle Rabby, and auld Sandy the Sutor,
will be caution that we’s face the session on Sunday, the lad’s
wae enough he did it, but he canna help it now, the weans
born and by hand; Sae goodnight wi’ your honour’s ladyship
it’s the first time e’er I was before you.</p>

<p>On Sabbath after sermon the session met, John and his
mother is call’d upon, he enters courageously, saying, Good-een
to you Master Minister, bellman and elders a’, my mither
and me is both here.</p>

<p>Mess John. Then let her in, come awa goodwife, What’s
the reason you keep your son so long back from answering
the session? you see it is the thing you are obliged to do at last.</p>

<p>Mith. Deed stir, I think there needs na be nae mair wark
about it, I think when he’s gien the lazy hulke, the mither o’t,
baith meal and groats<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to maintan’t, ye need na fash him, he’s
a dutifu’ father indeed, weel a wat, whan he feeds his bystart
sae weel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Mess John. Woman are you a hearer of the gospel? that
ye reject the dictates of it, how come you to despise the discipline
of the church? Is not offenders to be rebuked and
chastised?</p>

<p>Mith. Yes stir, a’ that is very true, but I hae been three or
four times through the Bible, and the New Testament, and I
never saw a repenting stool in’t a’; then whar cou’d the first
o’ them come frae, the Apostles had nane o’ them. But a daft
history book tells me, that the first o’ them was used about
Rome amang the Papists, and ay whan ony o’ them turn’d
Whigs, they were put on a four neuked thing, like a yarn
winnle blades, and rave a’ their gouls sindry till they turn’d
Papists again: and then for anger they put them on a black
stane or stool, in the mids o’ the kirk, and the seck goun about
them, wi’ the picture o’ the de’il and Satan on’t, a sweet be wi’
us, we sudna speak o’ the ill thief in the kirk, but it is
a mercy the minister’s here an’ he come, but that was the
original of your repenting stools, and whan the whigs
chas’d awa the Papist fouk out o’ this kintry, they left a wheen
o’ their religious pictures, and the stool o’ repentance was
amangst the spoil, but yese no get my bairn to set upon a
thing as hich as a hen bawk, and ilka body to be glowring at
him.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Mess John. Woman I told you formerly that any who refuses
submission to the government of the church, is liable to
excommunication: and that we are to put the law in execution
against adultery and fornication, or the sin thereof, lies
partly on our head.</p>

<p>Mith. As for your sin of adultery, I have naething ado
wi’t; I ken my son is a fornicator, and ye can neither mak
him better nor war nor he is, there’s nae man can keep a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
standing in their ain hand, fortune I mean, if it be a sin let
him confess’t, and forsake it, and wi’s pay the buttock-mail
and mak nae mair about it.</p>

<p>Mess John. Goodwife you need not think your son will
pass so, more than others that has been before him, he must
actually come before the congregation three sabbaths before
he be absolved from the scandal, and get the benefit of any
church privileges like any other honest man.</p>

<p>Mith. Indeed Mess John, my son will never set his hips
upon’t; if he maun come before you, I’se gar him stand a bit
a back frae’t and hear what ye hae to say about fornication,
twa harmless free bodies, passing their trials to see what they
can do, ye that’s whigs may mak enough o’t, but I think na
muckle about it.</p>

<p>Mess John. Woman you may go home and see what ye
have to do; ye have a very bad tongue: it’s no you we are to
take account of.</p>

<p>Mith. Ay, ay, ye that’s ministers and modest fouk may
say sae, but if my son had tane as good tent o’ his tail, as I
can do o’ my tongue, there had na been sae muckle about it,
a wheen silly loons kens na what they were made for, or how
to guide a thing whan they get it.</p>

<p>Mess John. Put her out, she’s going to speak baudy.</p>

<p>Mith. O ay, stir, I’se gang out, but I’ll hae my bairn out
wi’ me.</p>

<p>Mess John. We must first ask some few questions at him,
there is no harm can come on him here.</p>

<p>Mith. For as good company as you think yourselves, I
wad rather hae him in anither place.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
John’s kept in and his mother put out.
</p>

<p>Mess John. Well John, you must tell us whether this child
was gotten before ye was married, or since: for I suppose by
the time of the birth it is much about the same time.</p>

<p>Jock. Hout ay, stir, it was gotten lang or I was married, I
need na forget the getting, it was na sae easy to me.</p>

<p>Mess John. How long is it since ye was first acquaint?</p>

<p>Jock. Just when she came to be my mither’s lass, I never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
saw her but ance before, and gin I had never seen her, I had
never kend her in sic a fashious fashion.</p>

<p>Mess John. How long was she serving with your mother.</p>

<p>Jock. Just twa hail-yerts: and I got her wi bairn about a
year after she came, and its no a year yet since I was married.</p>

<p>Mess John. Dear John there is a contradiction indeed, a
woman cannot go two years with child.</p>

<p>Jock. Deed stir, it was then the wean was first gotten.</p>

<p>Mess John. A John, John, I find you out to be a sinful
liver, you and that woman has had carnal dealings for some
time; it is ill keeping the cow out of the corn, if she once got
a way of going to it, ye should actually a married the poor
woman, when ye cohabited so long together.</p>

<p>Jock. No stir, we didna cow habit, tho’ she kist me, and I
kist her, sometimes in the barn, and sometimes in the byre:
nane ken’t o’t but my mither, an’ she wadna let me tak her,
but sent me awa to court our Maggy.</p>

<p>His mother cries through the hole o’ the door: A ye senseless
sumph, is that a’ the thanks I get for counselling you to
do weel, war na me ye wad a been married on a lownlike
leepet lazy lump, who had neither wit nor wyles, no say much
judgment as wyfe the wind frae her tail but lute it gang afore
fouks.</p>

<p>Up gets the elders crying, Fy, fy, Duncan the bell-man
drive that wicked wife frae the door she disturbs us all.</p>

<p>Duncan runs to the door whispering, shame fa you for a
wife had out o’ that: but I wad rather hear you, as hear them yet.</p>

<p>Mess John. Now John will you be so plain as tell me
whether ye promist to marry the woman or no, when ye lay
with her.</p>

<p>Jock. Na stir, I didna lie wi’ her, for the herd and me lay
in the byre-bed, and she lay in the little lang sadle at the
hallen end.</p>

<p>Mess John. It is all one whether ye lay with her or not,
when ye have got her with child, that’s what ye confess.</p>

<p>Jock. I kenna whither I got her wi’ bairn or no: but I did
wi’ her as I did wi’ our Maggy, when she fell wi’ bairn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Mess John. But the question is, whether or no, did you
promise to marry her when that child was gotten?</p>

<p>Jock. Hut, tut, stir, ye wad fash fouk spiering a’ thing, it
was her that promist to marry me for the getting o’t.</p>

<p>Mess John. And did not you do the like to her?</p>

<p>Jock. A what needed I do the like when she and my
mither did it a’ but the wean getting, she could na do that.</p>

<p>Mess John. Indeed John you seem to have been a parcel
of loose livers altogether.</p>

<p>Jock. A loose stir, I wish I were loose yet, better be loose
than bun to an ill stake.</p>

<p>Mess. John. I see it is needless for me to enquire any
further into the matter, I find you out guilty, therefore, you
must appear publicly on the stool of repentance on Sabbath
next, and the two following thereafter, or ye be absolved from
the scandal.</p>

<p>Jock. Indeed master minister, am very easy about repentance,
and for your stool, its a seat am very indifferent about,
for am but bashful, and as I was never guilty o’ getting bystarts,
either before or sin syne, except in thoughts, words, deeds and
actions, I think ye may een let me pass, I suffered enough
wi’ the clash o’ the kintry, and loss o’ my ain wain, it was
nae bystart, ye canna gar me stand for that.</p>

<p>Mess John. You appear to be such a stupid fellow, the like
of you should neither have lawful child or bastard, and I
admire that such an ideot as you, was allowed to be married
to any woman; and you James, who is the elder of that proportion,
should have given information of this man’s capacity,
before he was joined to a wife.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Elder. Indeed sir, ye ken very well, he answered the questions
at the examine, better nor any other fouks, and I think
he is best married, for he might a gotten mae bystarts and
fasht us.</p>

<p>Jock. Indeed stir, it’s very true, for when ance I got the
gate o’ women, I cou’d na bide aff them, but our Maggy was
unco cunnen, she wad na let me do naething but kiss her and
kittle her till ance we was married.</p>

<p>Mess John. I’ll ask no more questions at him: call on his
mother, (in she comes,) Goodwife, we have ordered your son
to appear three Sabbaths on the stool an’ there to be reproved
before the congregation publicly an’ be absolved from the
scandal.</p>

<p>Mother. Than the ill thief be in his a&mdash;se Mess John, gin
e’er he set his hips upon’t, my bairn on your black stool? and
wadna’t be a great blunder on the auld black face o’t, to my
son to gang on’t before the young laird, who has had twa bystarts
and ne’er set a hip on’t yet, and he’s continually riding
on the hussies to this day, and them that wadna let him, he
rives their duds, and kicks their doups. A dear Mess John,
an ye gie gentle fouk a toleration to whore, to fornicate, kiss
an’ kuddle a wee, wi’ ilka body they like, I’ll gie you ten marks
and gie’t to me and my son too.</p>

<p>Mess John. And what shall we do with these odious persons?</p>

<p>Elders. Indeed, sir, we see not what we can make of them.</p>

<p>Mess. John. Make of them, we’ll exclude them from all
church benefit, and lay them under the lesser excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Mith. Indeed stir, tak your mind o’t as our cat did o’ the
haggies, when she sippit it a’, and crap in o’ the bag.</p>

<p>If ye winna christen the wean, ye canna hinder us to cast a
cogfu’ o’ water on the face o’t, and ca’t ony thing we like.</p>

<p>So out she goes shooting Jockey before her, so John went
and pisht on the auld minister’s widow’s gavel, and there was
nae mair about it that day.</p>

<p>Now Jockey and his mither came hame together, cheek for
chow cracking like twa hand guns.</p>

<p>Moth. I trow I have fought a battle this day, and win the
field condingly, whan I hae conquer’d a’ the canker’d carles
about the kirk.</p>

<p>Jock. Indeed mither I think ye are a better man nor the
minister, and gin ye had Arithmattock and Latin, to ken the
kittle figures you may preach as well as he.</p>

<p>Moth. I true Jock lad their black stool o’ sham repentance
ne’er got sic a rattle as I hae gient the day.</p>

<p>Jock. Na, na, mither, a’ the whoremongers that ever set a
hip on’t kens na sae muckle about the auld foundation o’t as

<p>Up gets auld Maggy, Jocks mither in the morning, puts on
the kettle, and maks her Yool sowens, the meikle pot hung on
the fire a’ night wi’ the cheek of an auld cows head, skims aff
the fat an’ mak’s a great cog o’ brose, then pours on a chappen
o’ clean creish like oil, which made a brave sappy breakfast for
Jockey and his mither, and Maggy got the cog to scart.</p>

<p>The brose being done and a’ thing ready, he halters the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>

<p>Jockey mounts, and his mother behind him, trots awa, till
coming down the brae abune John Davie’s well; the auld beast
being unfiery o’ the feet, she fundred before, the girth and

bruised a my back wi’ your auld hard banes, nor a wat a’
yoursel say, and see how ye hae drummel’d a John Davie’s
well.</p>

<p>Moth. Hech quo she, I wonder gin I be kill’d, thou always
was wont to get the word of a good rider, baith upon hussies
and horses, an’ this be thy management thou’s little worth;
fel’d the auld beans it bore thee! sic a bath as I hae gotten to
my Yool, thou coudna gien me a war bed nor a water hole in
a cauld frosty morning: wae be to thee an’ that ill gotten gett
o’ thine, O! let never better bounty be gotten wi’ bystarts
getting, an’ this is so much for the fruits o’ fornication, a war
stance nor the black-stool yet.</p>

<p>Jock. Let’s a be now wi’ your auld taunts about bystarts
getting, or I’se gie you the wind o’ the mare’s tail, an’ gar you
wammel hame an’ a’ your wate coats about you.</p>

<p>Moth. Na, na, my man Johny, haud the auld jade till I
loup on, we came together, and wi’s gang together, wi sall see
thy bystart and its mither or wi gae hame.</p>

<p>Jock. Wi’ a’ my heart mither, but yonder the house an’ the
hens on’t, the lums reeking rairly, but little ken they wha’s
coming.</p>

<p>At length they came to Jenny’s mother’s door.</p>

<p>Moth. Hech, is that poor body in her bed yet?</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
Her mother answers,
</p>

<p>Well a wat she’s in her bed, an’ cauld cauld, and comfourtless
is her lying; bystarts getting is just like lent gear, seldom
or ever weel paid back again; but my poor lassie coudna done
war nor she’s done, O! gin she had yielded her body to some
bit herd laddie, he wad a seen her lang or now.</p>

<p>Moth. A dear Marrion what wad ye be at? Do ye think
that our John wha has a wife o’ his ain, cou’d come an’ wait
on her as she were a dame o’ honour, or yet an honest man’s
wife, poor silly lown it she is, an’ he had thought on what he
was com’d o’ he wad ne’er a offer’d benevolence to the like o’
her.</p>

<p>Mar. An’ ye had been as great an instrogater against
his making her double ribbet, as ye’re now against doing
her justice, for the filthy jimcrack he’s gien her, ye wadna need
to ca’ her silly lown the day, an him an honest man; but the
ne’er an honest man wad a hoddl’d sae lang on a ae poor
hussie an’ then gane awa an a married anither for love of a
pickle auld clouts, and twa three pock-fou’s o’ tow: an she is
but a silly lown indeed that lute him or ony rattle-scul else,
shake their tail so lang upon her, without his faith, an’ his
troth, an’ his fist before the minister.</p>

<p>Moth. A cauld be your cast kimmer, do ye think it your
dadeling daughter’s a match fit for my son John; I think less
may sair, her father was but a poor cotter carle, an’ our John’s
father was a farmer, an’ its but a trick o’ youth, an’ the course
of youdeth maun be out; but she may thank good fortune an’
tell her friends ay, an’ count it a credit that ever she bore a
bystart to the like o’ him; a good fu fat farmer’s son, but ae
laigher nor a laird.</p>

<p>Mar. A wae be to sic a credit it’s no worth the cracking o’,
an’ whar was a’ his noble equals whan he bute to lay a leg on
a my poor lassie, poor clarty clukny it thou is? an’ if they warna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
baith ae man’s mak I wad think naething o’t; for they warna

but twa sticket taylors at the best? ye had as good a gane
hame an’ a counted bow-kail stocks, as to come here to count
kindred wi’ me.</p>

<p>Jock. Hout awa daft witless wives, I kenna what you’re
flyting about, I wad rather see the wean gin it be ony thing
wally and like the warld.</p>

<p>Mar. Indeed sall ye John, you’ll see your ain picture for
little siller, a muckle mouth’t haverel it is just like yoursel.</p>

<p class="pad20pc">
The child is presented.
</p>

<p>Jock. Mither, mither, it has a muckle mouth just like mine,
an’ sees wi’ baith ot’s een, an bit five days auld yet.</p>

<p>Moth. Dear Johny thou’s no wise man, wad tu hae the
wean to be blin, the poor thing saw whan it was new born.</p>

<p>Jock. A what ken I mither, am no sae weel skill’d as the
howdies, an’ them that’s ay hobbling weans: but I thought
they had a been like the wee bit’s a whalpies, nine nights auld
before they had seen ony.</p>

<p>Moth. Awa, awa, ye witless widdyfu’, comparing a beast
till a woman’s ain bairnie: a dog is a brute beast, an’ a wean
is a chrisen’d creature.</p>

<p>Jock. Na mither, its no a chrisen’d creature yet, for hit has
neither gotten the words nor the water, nor as little do I ken
how to ca’t yet.</p>

<p>Mar. I wat well it’s a very uncanny thing to keep about
a house, or yet t’ meet in a morning, a body wanting a
name.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Moth. Hout tout ay, ye it’s auld wives is ay fu o’ frits an’
religious fashions, them that looks to frits, frits follows them,
but it is six and thirty years since I was a married wife, an’ I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
never kend a sabbath day by a nither ane, mony a time till
the bell rang.</p>

<p>Mar. Dear guidwife what needs ye speak so loud? ye
fright the wean wi’ crying sae, see as it starts.</p>

<p>Moth. Ay, ay, the bystarts is a’ that way, but ken ye the
reason o’ that?</p>

<p>Mar. Ye that kens the reason of everything may soon find
out that too.</p>

<p>Moth. A deed than woman I’ll tell you, the merry begotten
weans, its bystarts I mean, is red wood, half wittet hillocket
sort o’ creatures: for an it be nae ane among twenty o’ them,
they’re a’ scar’d o’ the getting, for there’s few o’ them gotten
in beds like honest fouk’s bairns; but in out-houses, auld
barns, backs o’ dikes, and kil-loggies; whar there’s ay somebody
wandering to scar poor needfu’ persons, at their job of journay-wark:
for weel ken I the gaits o’t, experience gars me speak.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed mither that’s very true, for whan I was getting
that wean at the black hole o’ the peat stack, John Gammel’s
muckle Colly came in behind us wi’ a bow wow, of a great
goul just abune my buttocks; an’ as I’m a sinner, he gart me
loup laveruck height, an’ yet wi got a wean for a’ that.</p>

<p>Moth. A weel than Johnny that mak’s my words good yet.</p>

<p>Jenny answers out o’ the bed. A shame fa your fashions
ye hae nae muckle to keep whan ye tell how it was gotten,
or what was at the getting o’t.</p>

<p>Jock. A shame fa yoursel Jenny, for I hae gotten my
part o’ the shame else, an’ gin ye hadna tell’d first there wad
nane kend, for nae body saw us but John Gammel’s auld colly
an’ he’s no a sufficient witness.</p>

<p>Mar. Now guidwife amang a’ your tales ye hae tell’d me,
how is this wean to be maintain’d?</p>

<p>Moth. Ill chance on your auld black mouth Marrion, did I
not send you my guid sprittled hen, a pund of butter and a
sixpence, forby a libby o’ groats an’ a furlat o’ meal; mak her
a guid cogfu’ o’ brose, an’ put a knoist o’ butter in them, to
fill up the hole whar the lown came out, an’ I’ll send mair or
that be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Mar. An it be na better nor the last ye may een keep it
to your sell; your groat meal, and gray meal, sand dust and
seeds, course enough to feed cocks an’ hens, besides a woman
in her condition.</p>

<p>Moth. A foul be your gabs, ye’re a sae gash o’ your gabbies;
a whine fools that stives up your gutses wi’ guid meat,
to gar the worms turn wanton and wallop in your wames;
feed yourselves as I do, wi’ hacket kail brose, made o’ groat
meal, an’ gray meal, sand, seeds, dust an’ weak shilling, ony
thing is good enough to fill the guts an’ make a t&mdash;d of.</p>

<p>Jock. Na, na, mither an’ the wean wad suck our Maggy, I
sud take it hame in my oxter.</p>

<p>Moth. O ye fool, Maggy’s milk is a mould salt and sapless
lang syne; but I trow she wad keb at it, as the black ew did
at the white ews lamb the last year, sae speak nae mair o’
Maggy’s milk, no to compare a cat to a creature, the yeal cats
is never kind to kitlens, an’ the maiden’s bairns is a’ unco
weel bred.</p>

<p>Jock. Na, na, ye’re a’ mistane mither, Maggy has milk yet
for every pap she has is like a burn pig, I’se warrand ye they’ll
haud pints the piece.</p>

<p>Moth. My man Johny let them keep the wean, that has
the wean, we’ll never miss a pockfu’ of meal now and tan, I
wadna hae my bed pisht and blankets rotten for a bow o’ the
best o’t.</p>

<p>Jock. O mither! I canna lea’t I like it say weel it has twa
bonny glancing een, just like mine in a keeking glass, I wonner
how I was able to get the like o’t, indeed mither I think
mare o’ it, nor I do o’ my gray horse, Maggy an’ the four ky.</p>

<p>Moth. My man Johnny ye’re at nae strait about bairns
getting, nane needs to gang to London to learn that auld
trade; I ken very weel when ane gets warklums right to their
hand, nature will teach them how to fa’ to.</p>

<p>Jock. Now fare ye weel Janet, that wean is weel worth
the warkmanship, I’ll warrand ye weel a wat ist.</p>

<p>Jenny. Guidnight wi’ you John, but O man thou’s broken
my fortune, I’ll never get mair o’ a man nor I hae gotten, an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
dear, dear, hae I suffer’d for what I hae done, an’ if thou had
a bestowed thyself on a me, ye see what a bonny bairn time
we had a hane.</p>

<p>Moth. Thou says it thou’s suffer’d sadly for what thou’s
done, but though they wad take the hide o’er thy een holes it
wadna tak the inclination out o’ thee; for thou’ll do’t again,
but it’s no wi my bairn I’se warrand thee, an’ now Johnny
come awa hame to thy hauf marrow an’ use thy freedom as
formerly, thou’ll hae weans thick and three fauld; I’se make
thee a decoction of cock stanes, lamb stanes, an’ chicken broe,
will gar thee cock thy tail like a mevies an’ canter like a Galloway

<p><em>Being an Account of Jockeys Mother’s Death and Burial:

<p class="noindent">As Jockey and his mither came hobbling hame together on
the out side of the auld doil’d beast his mither’s black mare; a
waefu’ misfortune befel them;&mdash;Her hinderlets being wickedly
wet, in John Davie’s well that morning, and it being a frosty
night, her coats was a’ frozen round about her and the hard
harn sark plaid clash between her legs like a wet dish clout,
her teeth gaed like a rattle bag till almost haf gate hame, then
she was suddenly seiz’d wi’ a rumbling in her muckle bag,
what we kintry fouks ca’s a rush i’ the guts; Jockey was
fash’d helping her aff and helping her on, foul, fat and dirty
was the road, having like half a T&mdash;&mdash;d as ever tadder length.</p>

<p>Jock. Deed mither, I doubt death has something to do wi’
you, for there’s a rumbling in a your wame like an auld wife
kirning.</p>

<p>Mith. Hout tout I canna hear o’t, but they’ll be na fear o’
me now, I’m safe at my ain door, thanks to thee an’ the auld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
beast it brought me; heat my feet wi’ the bannock stane, an’
lay me in my bed, fling four pair o’ blankets an’ a cann’os on
me, I’ll be weel enough an’ ance I were better, swieth Maggy
gae mak me a cogfu’ o’ milk brose, an’ a placks worth o’ spice
in them, nae fear of an auld wife as lang as she’s loose behin,
an can tak meat.</p>

<p>Jock. I’se be’t mither, a e’en fill up the boss o’ your belly,
you’ll stand to the storm the better, I’se warran ye never die
as lang as you can tak your meat.</p>

<p>Ben comes Maggy wi’ the brose; but four soups an’ a slag
filled her to the teeth, till she began to bock them back again,
and ding awa the dish.</p>

<p>Jock. A mither, mither I dout there’s mair ado wi’ you nor
a dish to lick: whan ye refuse guide milk meat, I’m doubtfu’
your mouth be gaun to the mules.</p>

<p>Mith. A dear Johnny am no willin to die if I could do
better: but this will be a sair winter, on auld frail fouks, yet
an’ I wou’d grow better I might live these twenty years yet,
an’ be nae auld wife for a’ that: but alake a day there is e’en
mony auld fouk dying this year.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed mither there is fouks dying the year that
never died before.</p>

<p>Mith. Dear Johnny wilt thou bring me the doctor he may
do me some guide, for an my heart warna sick an’ my head
sae sair, I think I may grow better yet.</p>

<p>Jock. A weel mither, I’se bring the doctor, the minister,
an’ my uncle.</p>

<p>Mith. Na, na, bring nae ministers to me, his dry cracks ’ll
do me but little guid, I dinna want to see his powder’d pow,
an’ I in sic an ill condition; get me a pint o’ drams in the
muckle bottle, an’ set in the bole in the back side o’ my bed.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed mither ye’re in the right o’t, for ye want to
be weel warm’d within; to chace the call wind an’ frosty
water out at your back side.</p>

<p>Then awa he rins to draff Meg’s at the Kirktown, an’ brings
a bottle in every hand, out wi’ the cork an’ gies her ane in o’er,
she sets it to her gab an’ squattles up a mutchkin at a waught,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
which was like to wirry her till she fell a rifting and roaring
like an auld blunder-bush.</p>

<p>Mith. Hech hay, co’ she, but that maks an alteration and
wears awa the wind.</p>

<p>Wi’ that her head fell to the cod and she sughte awa, like a
very saint or drunken sinner.</p>

<p>Jock. O! Maggy, Maggy, my mither’s lost her breath,
(she’ll no live lang without it,) I doubt she be dead already,
and nae body seen her but ye and I and oursels twa; an’ she
had been fair o’er seen it maksna, I’ll no ha’d this a fair strae
death indeed, fy Maggy, cry in a’ the neighbours to see her
die, although she be dead. O an’ she wad but shake her fit,
or wag her muckle tae, it wad ay be some satisfaction:<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but
in came the neighbours in a hush, dinging ither down in the
door.</p>

<p>Jock. Come awa sirs, for my mither’s as dead as a mauk,
good be thanket for’t; but I’d rather it had a been the black
mare, or the muckle rigget cow, for weel a wat I’ll een miss
her, for she was a bra spinner o’ tow; an’ cou’d a cardet to
twa muckle wheels, she had nae faut but ane an that was her
tongue, but she’ll speak nae mair, fy gets a dale or a barn door
to straught her on, for ay whan she was cauld she was unco
kankert an’ ill to curch, but I’se hae her yerdet on Wednesday
teen.</p>

<p>Come, come, says Maggy, wi maun hae her drest.</p>

<p>Jock. What does the fool mean? wad ye dress a dead
woman, she’ll never gang to kirk nor market a’ her days again.</p>

<p>Mag. A dear John be at ease, ye ken she mauna be buried
as she is, a sark and winding sheet is the least she can get.</p>

<p>Jock. Ah ha Maggy is that what you mean, she has a guid
new windin sheet, it was never about her shoulders yet,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Maggy do’t a’ yoursell, and I’se gar clinkem Bell misure the
grave and mak it.</p>

<p>Now when they brought out the corps John told the people
they were welcome, to haud in a cheek o’ his auld mither wast
the gate; and being laid right on the spakes,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> ha! ha! quoth
he, this is a braw honestly indeed, its mair boukie nor my
bridal was, but when they came to the grave, it was o’er short
and strait about the mouth, which set John in a great
passion, saying a foul fa your naughty fashions master bell
man, did not I packshon wi’ you for the bried o’ my mither’s
back and the length o’ her carkage? an’ this hole winna haud
her thou’s get nae mair o’ my change if I sude die the morn.</p>

<p>Uncle Rabbie. Whisht, whisht, stir, this sude be a day o’
mourning for your mither, dinna flyte here.</p>

<p>Jock. What the vengeance uncle, sudna fouks die when
they’re auld? an’ am to pay for a hole and get but haf a hole;
that’s the thing that vexes me, but I’se keep twopence out o’
his trencher for’t, an’ se will I een; but gang ye hame uncle
to get cog and cap for the dradgey, and I’ll see her get fair
play or I gae.</p>

<p>Hame they came in a croud and fell to the cheese and
cheeks of leaves tuth and nail, the ale was handed about in
cogs and caps, lashing it down o’er like bletchers watering
their webs; John blutter’d in the cog like a cow in warm
water, till the barm and bubbles came belling out at his nose,
saying, a guide health to you a round about, an shoon and
shortly may wi a gang the gate may mither’s gane, an’ I wish
them a burying amang the dogs that speaks against it.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>About eight and twenty weeks thereafter Maggy had a
wally weame fu of weans to bear, an’ ay whan she cryed, John
cryed, which made a’ the kimmers and auld Katty the howdie
laugh heartily to hear them.</p>

<p>Katty. Here now John, your wife’s brought to bed wi’ a
bra lad bairn, gie him your blessing.</p>

<p>Jock. Well I wat he’s no want that, but an’ there had a
been samuckle din at the getting o’ him, as at the bearing o’
him, it sude ne’er a been gotten for me: Come, come, gets in
uncle Rabbie, the com riddle fu’ of the three nucket scons,
whang down the cheese like peats, eat and drink<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> as at my
mither’s dradgey, till wi forget our sorrow, and then weel see
Mess John about a name till him; since wi see its the way o’t,
that the young comes into the warld and chases out the auld,
wi maun chrisen them, and they maun bury us.</p>

<p>Now John and his uncle goes to the minister, he enters,
saying, guideen to you Mr. Minister ye dinna ken my mither’s
dead?</p>

<p>Minister. Yes John I heard so: but how is your wife?</p>

<p>Jock. My wife stir a wae worth her, for the wives o’ our
town an’ I hae gotten a waking night wi’ her; but wi hae gotten
her turn’d and still’d again, she’s born a bra wally thumping
stirra, he’ll herd the kye belyve to me an’ he had huggers on
him, an’ am come to you to get a bit name to him.</p>

<p>Minister. A bit name to him John, if ye want no more but
a name, ye may gie him that yourself.</p>

<p>Jock. Na but stir, I want baith the words and the water,
what ye say to ither fouks say to me.</p>

<p>Minister. A but John you must give security or satisfaction,
you’re a man under scandal.</p>

<p>Jock. What the muckle mischief stir, though under scandal
or abune scandal, will ye refuse to chrisen my wean that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
honestly gotten in my ain wife’s bed beneath the blankets;
caus I had a bystart, canna ye chrisen the weel com’d ane, let
the bystart stand for its ain skaith without a name.</p>

<p>Minister. No John you have been too slackly dealt with,
I’ll bring you to obedience by law, since you reject counsel.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed stir, I wad think naething to stan a time or
twa on’t to please you, if there were nae body in the kirk on
a uke day, but you an’ the elders to flyte a wee on me; but
its war on a Sunday, to hae a’ body looking and laughing at
me, as I had been coding the piese, suppen the kirn, or something
that’s no bonny like pissing the bed.</p>

<p>Minister. A well John never mind you these things, come
ye to the stool, its nothing when its over we cannot sae o’er
much to you about it.</p>

<p>Upon Sunday thereafter John comes in with uncle Rabbies
auld wide coat, a muckle great gray lang tail’d wig and a big
bonnet, which cover’d his face, so that he seem’d more like an
old Pilgrim than a young fornicator; mounts the creepy<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> with a
stiff stiff back as he had been a man of sixty, every one looked
at him, thinking he was some old stranger who knew not the
stool of repentance by another seat, so that he passed the first
day unknown but to very few, yet or the second it came to be
known, that the whole parish and many more came to see
him; which caused such a confusion that he was absolved,
and got his children baptized the next day.</p>

<p>But there happened a tullie between the twa mother’s who
would have both their names to be Johns, a weel, a weel says
old John their father to the minister, deed stir ye maun ca’ the
tean John an’ the tither Jock, and that will please baith these
enemies o’ mankind.</p>

<p>Minister. A well John suppose ye do, it is still twa Johns
nevertheless.</p>

<p>Jock. A deed stir, ye maun gie the wicked a’ their will,
wi’s ca’ the bystart Jockie, an’ my son Johnny Bell; On wi’t
some way and let her ca’t as she likes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Minister. A dear John but ye speak indifferently about
this matter, ye know not the nature of it.</p>

<p>Jock. A mony thanks to you Mess John, now caus ye hae
chrisend baith my bairn and my bystart I hope you’ll forgive
me the buttock mail.</p>

<p>Minister. John I desire you to be silent and to speak none
here: You must keep a straight walk in time coming, free of
scandal or offence.</p>

<p>Jock. Ay stir an’ how think ye the like o’ me can wak
straight wi’ sic auld shevelin heel’d shune as mine, amang such
rugh rigs, highs an’ hows as I hae to harl through.</p>

<p>Minister. I need not speak to you, you are but a poor
mean ignorant person.</p>

<p>Jock. Na stir welawat am neither poor nor yet mean, my
mither’s fairly yerdet now guide be thanket, and left a’ she

<p>Minister. But hear ye this John, ye must not kiss any
other woman nor<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> your own wife, live justly like another
honest christian, and you’ll come to die well.</p>

leg upon hissie again an they sude lie down to me while our

CREEL-WIFE’S DAUGHTER.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="noindent">All you that’s curious of Courtship, give attention to this
History of Mary and her son Sawny, a young Coalman, who
lived in the country a few miles from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Mary, his mither, was a gay hearty wife, had mair wantonness
nor wealth; was twelve years a married wife, nine years
a widow, and was very chaste in her behaviour, wi’ her ain
tale (for want of charging:) for a’ this time of her widowhood,
there was never a man got a kiss o’ her lips, or laid a foul
hand on her hind quarters.</p>

<p>Sawny her son was a stout young raw lown, full faced, wi’
flabby cheeks, duddy breeks, and a ragged doublet, gade always
wi’ his bosom bare, sometimes had ae gartan, a lingle or rash-rape
was good enough for Sawny: his very belly was a’ sun
burnt and brown like a piper’s bag, or the head of an auld
drum; and yet his beard began to sprout out like herring banes:
he took thick brose to his breakfast, and baps and ale through
the day, and when the coals sell’d dear, when the wind was
cauld, bought an oven farl and twa Dunbar weathers,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or a
Glasgow magistrate,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which fish-wives ca’s a waslen herrin.</p>

<p>His mither, auld Mary plagued him ay in the morning, got
up when the hens keckled, reinged the ribs, blew her snotter-box,
primed her nose, kindled her tobacco pipe, and at every
puff breathed out fretting against her hard fortune, and lanely
single life. O but a widow be a poor name, but I live in a
wilderness in this lang-lonen; mony a man gaes by my door,
but few looks in to poor auld Mary: Hoch hey, will I never
win out o’ this weery’d life.&mdash;Wa’ Sawny man, wa’ Sawny
man; wilt thou na rise the day; the sun’s up, an a’ the nibours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
round about; Willie and Charlie is to the hill an hour syne,
an’ haf-gate hame again. Wilt thou rise and gi’ the beasts a
bite; thou minds na’ them, I wat man.</p>

<p>Grump, grump, quo’ Sawny, they got their supper an hour
after I got mine. Shute to dead come on them, an’ they get
a bit frae me till they work for’t.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> But O Mither, I been dreaming that I was married,
an’ i’ the bed aboon the bride, I wonder gin it be true:
Od! I never got sic fun; what wilt be, think ye? How auld
am I mither; do you think I could man a hissy yet? Fegs
am a mind to try, but the sour saucy hissies ’ill no hae me, I
ken well enough.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Hae you lad, ay mony a hungry heart wad be
blyth o’ you; but there was never a sca’d Jocky but there was
a scabbit Jenny till him yet:<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> dinny be fear’d lad.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A hech, mither, I’se no be lordly, an I sud tak a
beggar wife aff the hi’ gate: but I’ll tell you something it’m
ay thinking on, but ye manna tell the nibours, for the chields
wad aye jamf<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> me wi’t.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Wad I tell o’ thee, I wad tell o’ mysel as soon.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Do ye mind, mither, that day I gaed to the Pans<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
I came in by Auld Mattie’s, your countrymans, the Fife wife,
it came out o’ the town ye came frae, the wife it says, <em>Be-go
laddie</em>, I gaed there, and she wisna in, and her doughter kend
me; she was unco kind, and made me fat, fat brose out o’ the
lee side o’ her kail pat, there was baith beef and paunches in’t:
od they smell’d like ony haggies, an’ shin’d a’ like a gou’d lac’d
waiscoat, figs I suppit till I was like to rive o’ them, and had
a rift o’ them the morn a’ day; when I came out, I had a kite
like a cow wi’ ca’f. She spier’d for you mither, and I said ye
was gaily: and she looked to me, and leuch ay, and grippet
my shakle bane, and said I wad be a sturdy fallow yet.&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
looked ay to her, and thought I liked her, and thinks on’t ay
sin-syne, she leugh, and bad me seek out a coal-driver for her,
for she did na’ like to carry a fish creel.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Forsooth, Sawny, I’ll gie my twa lugs for a
lav’rocks egg if she binna in love wi’ thee, and that will be a
bargain.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> An’ upon my word mither she’s a sturdy gimmer,
well worth the snoaking after; she has a dimple in every cheek,
and ane on her chin, twa legs like twa posts, an haunches like
a sodger’s lady’s hoop, they hobble when she shakes, and her
paps plays nidity nod when she gangs, I ken by her keeking<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
she has a conceit o’ me.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> But Sawny man, an tou see her mither Matty in
the town, auld <em>Be-go-laddie</em>, as ye ca’ her, gi’ her a dram, she
lik’st well; spout ye a mutchkin o’ molash in her cheek, ye’ll
get her mind an’ speed the better.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> But mither how sud I do when I gang to court
her; will I kiss her and tan kittle her, an’ fling her o’er as the
chiels does the hissies amang the hay. I seen them gang
our ither, and o’er ither; an’ when they grip them by the wame,
they’d cry like a maukin when the dogs is worrying them.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Hut awa’, daft dog it thou is, that’s no the gate,
thou maun gang in wi’ bra’ good manners an’ something manfu’;
put on a Sunday’s face and sigh as ye were a saint; sit
down beside her as ye were a Mess John; keek ay till her now
and then wi’ a sto’en look, and had your mouth as mim, and
grave as a May-puddock, or a whore at a christening; crack
well o’ our wealth, and hide our poverty.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Ay but mither, there’s some other way in courting
nor that, or the lasses would never couple so close to them.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Ay but Sawny man, there is a time for everything
and that too; when ye sit where nae body sees you, you may
tak her head in your oxter, like a creesh pig, dab nebs wi’ her
now an’ than, but be sure ye keep a close mouth when ye kiss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
her; clap her cheeks and straik her paps, but for your drowning
gang nae farther down; but fouk’s that’s married can put
their hand to ony part they like.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Aha, but mither, I didna ken the first word o’
courting, the lassie ’ill no ken what am com’d about.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Ay will she lad, wink and keek well to her, she’ll
hae a guess; seek a quiet word o’ her at the door; an’ gin it
be dark, gie her a wee bit kiss when ye’ve tell’d her your
errand; an’ gin they gi’e you cheese and bread, or ony meat, ca’t
good, whether it be sae or no; and for my blessing, be mensfu’
wi’ your mouth, and dinna eat o’er muckle, for I seen you sip as
mony milk brose as wad a sar’t twa men to carry on a barrow.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A but mither, ye’re lying now, or it was na’ a’ at
ance than, but an they set meat before me, and I be hungry, a
de’il claw the clungest<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> an’ I be nae upsides wi’t, for that same.
A faith mither, fouks maun hae meat, an’ they should ne’er
get wives, there’s some o’ them no worth the cursing, an’ a
body were na letting an oath whether or no: a hear ye that
now, when ye pit me till’t, and gar me speak; ay by my sooth,
I wad rather hae a bit good powny<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> an’ a pound o’ cheese, or
I were bound to bab after ony hizzies buttocks I see yet.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Wa Sawny man thou’s a fool an’ that’s a fau’t:
gin every ane were as easy about women as thou is, the warld
wad be a wilderness in a wee time; there wad be nae body to
inhabit the earth but brute beasts, cats and dogs wad be worrying
ither, and every thing gae to confusion. Gae to the courting
ye dog it ye are, and either do something or naething at a’.</p>

<p class="noindent">Up got Sawny in the morning, and swallowed o’er his sodden
meat, slag by slag; and aff he goes to the coals and the
courting, lilting and singing like a lav’rock in a May mornin,
<em>O to be married if this be the way</em>. The colliers wonder’d a’
to see him sae well busket, wi’ a pair o’ wally side auld
fashioned breeks o’ his father’s,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and a lang cravate like a
minister, or Baillie Duff at a burial, a clean face and hands,
and no less than a gun sleev’d linen sark on him, which made
his cheeks to shine like a sherney weight, and the colliers
swore he was as bra’ as a horse gawn to a cow’s dredgy.</p>

<p>But Sawny came aff wi’ his coals whistling, and whipping
up the poor beast e’en as outragious as ony ram at riding
time; well might ony body see there was a storm in Sawny’s
nose, light where it like; for no sooner had he sell’d his coals
than he left his horse to come hame wi’ a nibour callen, and
gade keeking up the Cow-gate, and thro’ the closes, seeking
auld <em>Be-go</em> his good-mither to be, then in thro’ the fish market
where he bought a lang herrin, an’ twa baps, a pair of suters
auld shoon greesed black and made new, to make his feet
feasible like, as he kend the lass wad look at them, (for his
mither tell’d him the women look’d ay to the men’s legs or
they marry’d them, and the well-legged louns gade ay best aff.)</p>

<p>So Sawny came swaggering through a’ the shell wives, but
she was nae there, but coming down the town beneath the
guard, meets auld <em>Be-go</em> just in the teeth, and crys, hey laddie
my dow, how’s your mither honest Mary? I thank you co’
Sawny, she’s meat-heal, and ay working some, how is a’ at
hame, is Kate and the laddie well?</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> Fu’ well my dow, you’re a bra’ soncy dog grown, a
wally fa’ me gin I kend ye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Come, come, co’ Sawny, and I’ll gie you a nossock to heat
your wame, it’s a cauld day, an’ ye’re my mither’s countryman.</p>

<p>Na’ fair fa’ you Sawny, I’ll no refus’t, a dram’s better the
day nor a clap on the arse wi’ a cauld shule, sae fallow me
my dow.</p>

<p>So away she took me, co’ Sawny, down a dark stair to ane
o’ the how houses, beneath the yird, where it was mirk as in a
coal heugh,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and they had a great fire, <em>Sweet be wi’ me</em>, co’
Sawny, <em>for it minds me o’ the ill part</em>, an’ a muckle pot like a
little caldron, seething kail and roasting flesh, the wife forket
them out as fast us she cou’d into cogs and caps, for there
came in a whin sutor-like fallows wi’ black thumbs and
creashy aprons, that cuttied them a’ up in a wee time, but
they ne’er fashed wi’ us nor we with them; we first got a gill
and then a het pint; a vow said I Matty, is nae Kate gawn to
get a man yet?</p>

<p>A man laddie, a wha wad hae her? a muckle lazy useless
jade, she can do naething but work at husband wark;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> card
and spin, wash ladies rooms, and scour gentlemen’s bonny
things, she canna tak a creel on her back, and apply to merchandizing
as I do to win a man’s bread.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> I think some o’ the fishers and her may mak
it up.</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> A fisher laddie, hech the fishers has a better look out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
wi’ them, the fishers wad rather hae a pickle good baits to their
hooks, and twa three bladders to their lines, then put up wi’
the like o’ her, a stinking pridefu’ jade, although I bore her, ay
scraping and washing at hersel, pricking and prining, keeps
her face ay like a Flanders baby, and no less nor ribbons and
rings, and her shone made o’ red clouts; an’ de’il stick pride,
when our auld goodum ran barefoot, and our gutchers gaed
wi’ bare hips. Gie her a man, ill thief stap a gouk in her arse
first, that it may cry cuckow whenever she speaks o’t; she can
do naething but scour ladies piss pots, and keep clean the
tirlie whirlies that hangs about the fire, heth she’s o’er gently
brought up to be a poor man’s penny worth.</p>

<p>Hegh how co’ Sawny, an’ its e’en a great pity, for she’s a
weel far’d lusty hissy, I had a great kindness for her.</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> A-well-a-wat she’s no lingle tail’d, she may be a
caff-bed to a good fallow; but an thou had seen me at her
age, I was a sturdy gimmer: there was na ane about a’ the
Hyne or Dubby-side, cou’d lay a curpen to a creel wi’ me;
the fient a fallow in a’ Fife, but I wad a laid him on the braid
o’ his back, an’ a’ his gear upmost, I was a chiken to chatter
wi’ indeed laddie, I had a pair o’ cheeks like a chapman’s arse,
and a flank like an ox; sae had I een.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Nae doubt co’ <ins class="corr" id="tn-55" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Sawney but ye'">
Sawny but ye</ins> had a pair o’ beefy
buttocks, for your very cheeks hings like leather bags to this
very day; but I’ll tell you what am gaun to tell you, do you
think that your Kate wad tak me, an I wad come to court her.</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> Tak you laddie, tak you, a faith she’ll tak you, for
she wou’d a tane a poor button thing of a half blind taylor,
wartna me, a poor, bleir’d scabbit like creature it was, I seen the
day I wou’d ha carried it in my pouch: wode I’se warrent her
jump at you like a fish at a flee, wode I say tak you, an’ she
winna tak you I’se tak you mysel; but she and I cust out the
day, about her cockups and blackcaps, gard me say sae
meickle o’ her, but she’s my sonsy dawty for a’ that, weel a
wat she’s a weel natured lassie an’ she turn an ill-natured wife
I canna tell.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A we’ll then I’ll venture on her as she is, for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
mither’s pleased, and ye’re pleas’d, an’ am pleas’d, an’ in she
be pleas’d wode I am sure to get her, an’ the taylor has nae
bridled her, or tane a trying trotty o’ her.</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> But Sawny man, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, I’ll hame
and broach her the night on’t, an’ come ye the morn, we’ll
make it fude fast in a wee time, so thou’s get mair tocher than
a cramon, <em>gamon to gamon</em>, she has baith blankets and sheets,
a covering and twa cods, a caff-bed and bowster, and hear’st
thou me laddie, I have a bit auld hogger<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> an’ some thing in’t,
thou’s get it when I die; but by my suth it will be the last
thing that I will part wi’, I kenna what I may need yet, its an
auld wife kens her wierd.</p>

<p>On this they paid their spout<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and parted; but when
Sawny came out he stoited and stagger’d like a sturdy stot,
molash was chief commander, for he thought every body had
two heads and four een and more noses than they needed;
being sometime in the dark house, thought it was the morning
of a new day, a hech said he, when was I a night frae
my mither before, she’ll think I am put in the guard, tane wi’
the deel, or the doctors, or anse married, and wirking at the
wanton wark o’ wean’s making.</p>

<p><em>Mat.</em> Hute daft laddie, the soup drink’s in your head, this
day and yesterday is a’ ae day, ye’ll be hame in bra’ time yet.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A well a well then good day to you good-mither,
ye maun gar Kate tak me or thief tak you a’ the gither, I’ll
hame and tell the length its come, an’ it come nae farther it
maun e’en stick there.&mdash;Off he goes tacking about like a ship
against the wind, as if he would knock holes in the wa’s and
windows wi’ his elbows, he looked as fierce as a lion; wi’ a red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
face like a trumpeter, and his nose was like a bublie-cocks neb,
as blue as a blawirt; but or he wan half way, his head turned
heavier nor his heels, and many a filthy fa’ he got, through thick
and thin he plash’d, till hame he gets at last, grunting and graping
by the wa’s, that auld Mary his mither thought it was their
neighbour’s sow, he was so bedaubed wi’ dirt, gets him to bed,
he was in a boiling barrel fever, and poor Mary grat wi’ grief.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Hech hey co’ Sawny, but courting be a curst wark,
and costly, an’ marriage be as mortifying and murdering, the
devil may be married for me.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Wa, Sawny man what’s come o’er thee now, thou’s
gotten skaith, some auld wife has witcht thee,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> or the deel
has dung thee o’er in some dirty midden, my bairn’s elf-shot;
whar has thou been, or what hast thou seen, thy een reels like
a wild cat, and the sweat is hailing o’er thy nose, thou’s
witcht, O man what will I do!</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Bock, bock co’ Sawny, but it couldna win up wi’
bubbles and herrin banes, o’ co’ Sawny put me in my bed, for
my days will soon be done, a curse on your courting wark, for
its kill’d me, and wives is but wicked things I ken by the same.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> O dole! dole my bairn has gotten poison, for the
smell o’t is like poison to me.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Gin herrin and het ale be poison, there’ll no be
mony left alive: Bock co’ Sawny, the bed’s filld.</p>

<p class="noindent">Poor Sawny had a terrible night o’t, wi’ a sair head, and a
sick heart, his een stood in his head, his wame caddled like
onny mill trows,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and a’ his puddings crocket like a wheen
paddocks in a pool; his mither rocket and wrang her hands,
crying a wae be to the wife that brew’d it! for I hae lost a
well foster’d bairn, wi’ their stinking stuff, a meikle deel ding
the doup out o’ their ca’dron, my curse come on them and
their whisky pots, its burnt him alive, ay, ay, my bairn he’s
gone.</p>

<p>But about the break of day, his wind brake like the bursting
of a bladder; O happy deliverance! cried Mary his mither,
tho’ dirt bodes luck,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and foul farts files the blankets, I wish
ne’er war be amang us. The next thing that did Sawny good
was, three mutchkins o’ milk made in thin brose, and a fine
pickle pepper in them, yet he had a soughing in his lugs like
a saw-mill, and every thing ran round about wi’ him a’ that
day. Yet his mother got him out o’ the bed, on o’ the meikle
chair, a pair o’ blankets about his shoulders, a cod at his back,
and a hot brick to his soles, to gar him true he was nae well;
and there he sat like a lying-in wife, cracking like a Hollander,
and ate twa dead herrin and a cufe,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> telling a’ the outs and ins
about his bridal, and whan it was to be; for he had gotten
every body’s consent but the bride’s about it.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> But Sawny man that’s the main thing, ye maun
hae that too.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Na, na, mither am the only thing myself, she’s but
a member, the men maun ay be foremost, gang what way it
will, I’se ay be the uppermost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> But Sawny man, what way is thou gaun to do?
will ye mak a pay penny wedding?<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> or twa three gude neighbours,
a peck o’ meal baken, wi’ a cheese, and a barrel o’ ale,
will that do?</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Na, na, mither, I’ll take a cheaper gate nor ony o’
them; I’ll gar haf-a-crown and haf-a-mutchkin or a rake o’
coals do it a’, then a body has nae mair a-do but piss and
then go to bed syne.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Na, na, my man Sawny, I have mony, mony a
time, heard thy honest father say, that never a ane wad do well
that cap-strided the kirk, or cuckol’d the minister.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A tell na me mither, o’ the ministers; they’re ay
for their ain hands as well as other fouks, an’ if a poor beggar
body had a bit wean to chrisen, the deil a doit they feike

<p><em>Mither.</em> Hute awa man, there’s nae body has weans, but
what has siller to pay the chrissening o’ them; or if they be

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Ha, ha, mither the poor foukes like the lice; ay
when they meet they marry and maks mae o’ them: And I
think the ministers might chrisen their bits a weans for nae<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>

they’re well paid</ins> for their
preaching, they may very well both marry and chrisen a’ the
poor foukes into the bargain, by the way of a maggs.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Ay, ay, my man Sawny, marriage is a sweet thing
for young fouke an’ the bed undefil’d.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> What the vengeance mither, do ye think that a
body is to file the bed every night, an’ they do’t ance.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> Na, na, that’s no what I mean, its happiness
that fouk has that’s married, besides the wearied lonesome life
it I hae, lying tumbling and gaunting in a bed my lane; O
sirs! but a man in a bed be a usefu’ body, an’ it were but to claw
ane’s back, as for a body’s foreside they can claw it themsel.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A’ mither, mither, ye hae fun a string again, I
think ye might a wanted a’ your days when ye fasted sae
lang; ye hae plenty o’ baith milk and meal, snuff and tobacco,
but ye smell at the crack o’ the whip, I kend my mither wad
ride yet; for I seen her fit wagging this lang time.</p>

<p><em>Mither.</em> A dear Sawny man, an thou were ance fairly aff
the fodder, I’ll be casten into a hole of a house by mysel,
where I’ll just ly and break my heart, and weary mysel to
dead, but an I cou’d get a bit honest weaver, a cobler, or
some auld taylor by the tail, I wad tickle to him yet, let the
country clash as they please about it.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A well, a well, then mither, take then your ain flight;
there’s nae fool to an auld fool; for the morn I’se be aff or
on wi’ the hissy I hae on hand.</p>

<p>So on the morning Sawny got a’ his clase clean, his hair
cam’d and greas’d wi’ butter, and his face as clean as the cat
had licket it; and away he goes singing.</p>

<p>Now poor Sawny altho’ he sang, was as pale as a ghost
from the grave, his face was whitly white, like a well bleatch’d
dish-clout, he looked just as he had been eaten and spued
again; but at length he came to the bride’s door, and in he
goes wi’ a brattle, crying how is a’ here the day? an’ what’s
com’d o’ thy mither lassie? O Saunders said the bride she’s
awa’ to the town, what came o’ you yesterday, she waited on
you the whole day; ye gart her lose a day’s trade lad, and
she is away this morning cursing like a heathen, an’ swearing
<em>be-go</em> that ye hae geen her a begunk.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> A dole woman, I took a sudden blast o’ the hame
gawn, an’ was never so near dead in my life.</p>

<p>An’ wha think you was in company wi’ Kate the bride, but
the wee button of a taylor, who sat and sewed on a table,
cocking like a t&mdash;d on a trencher, but when he kend wha was
com’d he leaped down on the floor, custe a dash o’ pride like
a little bit prince, he bobet about, and so out he goes with the
tear in his eye, and his tail between his feet like a haff worried
colly-dog.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Now Katty do ye ken what I’m com’d about?</p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> O yes my mither tell’d me, but I’m no ready yet, I
have twa gowns to spin, and things to mak.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Hute, things to mak, ye have as mony things as

me, as right as here wi’ an auld girning mither?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> But dear Saunders, ye must give a body time to
think on’t, ’twad be ill far’d to rush together just at the first.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> And do ye think I have naething a-do, but come
here every other day hoiting after you? it’ll no do, I maun be
either aff wi’ you or on wi’ you, either tell me or tak me, for I
ken of other twa, and some o’ you I will hae, for as I’m a sinner
my mither is gawn to be married too, an’ she can get a
bit man of ony shape or trade.</p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> Indeed then Saunders, since you’re in such a haste,
you must e’en tak them that’s readiest, for am no ready yet.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Dear woman whan your mither an’ my mither’s
pleas’d, am willing to venture on ye, what a sorrow ails you?</p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> Na, na I’ll think on’t twa or three days; it’s o’er
lang a term to see without a thought.</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Wode I think ye’re a cumstrarie piece o’ stuff, it’s
true enough your mither said o’ ye, that ye’re no for a poor
man.</p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> And what mair said she o’ me?</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> Wode she said you could do naething but scure
wash mugs, an’ gentlemen’s bonny things, but hissies it is bred
amang gentle houses, minds me o’ my mither’s cat, but ye’r
far costlier to keep, for the cat wastes neither saep nor water,
but spits in her lufe and washes ay at her face, and whins o’
you can do nae ither thing, and up he gets.</p>

<p><em>Kate.</em> O Saunders but ye be short, will ye no stay till my
mither come hame?</p>

<p><em>Sawny.</em> I stay’d long enough for any thing I’ll be the
better; and am no sae short as your totum of a taylor it I
cou’d stap it my shoe, sae cou’d I e’en.</p>

<p>Hame he goes in a passion, and to his bed he ran crying,
O death, death! I thought the jade wad jumpet at me; no
comfort nor happiness mair for poor me. O mither gar make
my burial bread, for I’ll die this night or soon the morn.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But early next morning in comes auld <em>Be-go</em> his good mither,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
who had left her daughter in tears for the slighting o’ Sawny;
and haules him and his mither away to get a dinner of dead
fish, where a’ was agreed upon, the wedding to be upon
Wednesday; no bridal fouks but the twa mithers and themselves
twa.</p>

<p>So according to appointment they met at Edinburgh, where
Sawny got the cheap priest,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who gave them twa three words,
and twa three lines, took their penny and a good drink, wish’d
them joy and gaed his wa’s. Now said auld <em>Be-go</em>, if that be

<p>[This is another unique specimen of the early chap-book from the library of
George Gray, Esq. The original is in three numbers of eight pages each, breaks
being made in the narrative without respect to any thing but the filling of requisite
space. The first number bears the title:&mdash;‘The History and Comical Transactions
of Lothian Tom. In Six Parts. Wherein is contained a Collection of
Roguish Exploits done by him, both in Scotland and England,’ while the other
two are but modifications of it. There is this addition on the third number:&mdash;‘Which
contains a dialogue betwixt Tom and Pady about their questions, and
Tom’s song.’ They were all printed in Niddery’s Wynd, Edinburgh: the first in
1775, the second in 1777; while the third is without date. Since the Introduction
to these volumes was written we have seen an edition of this chap-book published by
Morren, Cowgate, Edinburgh, without date. It is a 24 pp. 12mo., and contains all
the material to be found in the edition from which the following pages are printed,
including Tom’s Song. In this edition, however, ‘Pady’s New Catechism’ is
made part VI., while part II. as in the 1775 edition, with additions and alterations,
is incorporated into part I. The ‘Catechism,’ as already explained, does not seem
to belong to this chap-book, but to ‘Pady from Cork.’]</p>

LOTHIAN TOM.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="noindent">This Thomas Black, vulgary called Lothian Tom, because of
that country, was born four miles from Edinburgh, his Father
being a very wealthy farmer, who gave him good education,
which he was very awkward in receiving, being a very wild
cross mischievous boy.</p>

<p>When he was about 10 years of age, he was almost killed
by the stroke of a horse’s foot, which his father had; who had
a trick of kicking at every person that came in behind him.
But when Tom was got heal of the dreadful wound, whereof
many thought he would have died. To be even with the
horse, he gets a clog, or piece of tree which was full of wooden
pins; a thing which the shoe makers used to tann their
leather upon; and with a rope he tied it to the cupple balk in
the stable, directly opposite to the horse’s tail, gets up on the
balk and gives it a swing back so that the pikes in the end of
it, came with a full drive against the horse’s arse; which made
him to fling and the more he flung and struck at it, it
rebounded back again and struck him; the battle lasted with
great fury for a long time, which was good diversion for Tom,
until his father hearing some disturbance in the stable, came
in to know the matter, and was surprized when he saw the
poor horse tanning his own hide, with his legs all cut and
bloody, with kicking against the pikes of the tanners stool;
so he cut the rope and the battle was ended, but the poor
horse would never kick at any thing that came behind him
afterwards, but always run from it.</p>

<p>It happened one day that Tom went a fishing and brought
home a few small fish, which his grandmother’s cat snapt up
in the dark; so Tom to have justice of the cat for so doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
catches her, and puts her into a little tub cogbome,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> then sets
her a drift into a mill-dam, ordering her to go a fishing for
herself; then sets two or three dogs upon her, where a most
terriable seafight ensued as ever was seen in fresh watter: for
if any of the dogs assayed to board her, by setting in over
their nose, badrons came flying to that quarter, to repulse him
with her claws; then her vessel was like to overset by the
weight of herself, so she had to flee to the other, and finding
the same there, from thence to the middle, where she sat mawing,
always turning herself about, coming her nose with her
foot. The old woman being informed of the dangerous situation
of her dearly beloved cat, came running with a long pole
to beat off the dogs and haul her ashore: What now, says
Tom, if you be going to take part with my enemies, you shall
have part of their reward: then gives the old woman such a
push that she tumbled into the dam over head and ears, beside
her beloved cat, and would undoubtedly perished in the water,
had not one of the people who were there looking at the diversion,
com’d to her relief.</p>

<p>After this Tom was sent to the school to keep his hands
out of an ill turn; and having an old canker’d crab witted
fellow for his dominie, they were always at variance, for if
Tom had got his whips, which he often deserved, he was sure
to be revenged upon his master again for it. So Tom perceiving
<ins class="corr" id="tn-68" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'his mastre had'">
his master had</ins> a close-stool in a little closet within the
school, where he went and eased himself when need was:
Tom gets a penny-worth of gun powdar, and strinkled it on
the ground directly before the seat, and lays a little of it along
in a train to the fire side, then perceiving when his master
went into it, and as he was loosing down his breeches, sets
fire to the train which blew it all up about his master’s bare
hips, which scorched him most terriably, besides the fright; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
which Tom was severely whipt; yet in a little after he began
to study revenge on his master.</p>

<p>So it happened one day as Tom went into the master’s
house, the wife was stooping into a big meal barrel<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to bring
out some meal; there he takes her by the feet and cowps her
up into the barrel with her head down, and her bare backside
upper-most; then runs into the school, crying, “O! master,
master! the deel’s looking out of your meal stand wi’ a fat
face, and a black ill far’d mouth: yon’s just auld nick and he
be living.” At this the master run with all speed he could to
see what it was, and found it to be his own wife speechless
and almost smothered to death; but as she could not tell who
did it, Tom got clear off; yet he was not satisfied without
some more vengeance on the old fellow; and knowing his
master had a fashion when he was going to whip the boys,
if they would not loose their breeches willingly, he drew his
knife and cut them thro’ the waistband behind: so Tom goes
to a butcher and gets a raw pudding, and fills it with blood
and watter and puts it in within the waistband of his breeches:
then goes to school next day, and as the master was sitting
with his back towards the fire, Tom lights a piece of paper
and sets his wig in a low, which burnt for some time unperceived,
until the flames came fizing about his ears: he first
put out the wig by trampling it upon the ground with his feet,
and being informed that Tom did it, flies to him in a rage,
ordering him to loose his breeches, but Tom told him he was
never so mad: then he drew his knife and whips poor Tom
over his knee, and with great kicking and struggling cuts the
waistband of his breeches through pudding and all, so that
the blood gushed out; and Tom cried murder, murder, and
down he fell. The poor dominie went out of the door crying
and wringing his hands. Word flew about that Tom was
sticket by the dominie, which made the people come running
from several parts of the country round about to see how it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
was; but searching him for the wound, found none but the
empty pudding, which discovered the fraud.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Then two men
had to get horses and ride after the poor dominie, who had by
this time got two or three miles away; and when he saw them
coming after him, crying to stand, and come back again, he
ran the faster, untill he could run no more, but fell over on
the road, praying him to let him go, for if he was taken back
he was sure of being hanged: and would not be persuaded that
Tom was alive, until they forced him back and he saw him:
but he would be Tom’s teacher no longer; so Tom’s father
had to seek another master for him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lsp2">Part II.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was a young woman servant to Tom’s father, which
Tom had offended by some of his tricks, and she to be up
with him again; one night spread a handfull of short nettles
in his bed, between his sheets; which stinged his legs and
thighs so much, that he was obliged to quit his bed, for some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
part of the night; for which he resolved to be revenged when
ever a proper opportunity offered. It happened in a few days
after that she was invited to a wedding where the dancing and
diversion induced her to stay all night; and on coming home
in the morning, her mistress set her to wash some cloaths.
But she being fatigued with her night’s diversion, and for
want of rest fell fast asleep with her hand extended in the
tub, and standing on her feet with her belly leaning on the
tub, Tom perceiving this, slips her petticoats and smock over
her head, letting the sun shine on her bare back side, which
faced the highway. Several people passing by while she continued
in this posture, some of them were diverted, and others
ashamed at the sight. But a poor cadger had the misfortune
to be coming on the road at the time, and his horse taking
fright at this unusual sight, threw off the creels which broke
the poor man’s eggs all to smash. Which so enraged him,
that he lashed her buttocks with his whip in so unmerciful a
manner, that with the smart and shame together, she had
not the least inclination to sleep for the remaining part of
the day.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Tom being grown up to the years and age of a man, thought
himself more wiser and slyer than his father; and there was
several things about the house he liked better than to work:
so he turned to be a dealer amongst the brutes, a couper of
horses and cows, &amp;c. and even wet ware amongst brewers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
brandy shops; until he couped himself to the toom halter;
and then his parents would supply him no more. He knew
well his grandmother had plenty of mony, but she would give
him none; but the old woman had a good black calf her own,
which Tom went to the fields one evening and catches and
takes her into an old waste house which stood at a distance
from any other, and there he kept her two or three days,
giving her meat and drink when it was dark at night, and
made the old woman believe some body had stole the cow for
their winter mairt:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which was grief enough to the old
woman, for the loss of her dearly beloved cow. However,
she employs Tom to go to a fair that was near by, to buy her
another, gives him 3 lr<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which Tom accept of very thankfulli
and promised to buy one as like the other as possibly he could
get; then he gets a piece of chalk and brays it small as meal,
and steeps it in a little water, and therewith rubs over the
cow’s face and back which made her both brocket and rigget:
So Tom in the morning takes the cow to a public house within
a little of the fair, and there left her till the fair was over, and
then drives her home before him; and as soon as they came
home the cow began to rout as she used to do, which made the
old woman so rejoice, thinking it was her own black cow; but
when she saw her white face, sighed and said, “Alas! thou’ll
never be like the kindly brute my black lady, and yet routs as
like her as ony I ever did hear;” but Tom says to himself, the
mercy is you know not what she says, or all would be wrong
yet. So in two or three days the old woman put forth her bra’
rigget cow in the morning with the rest of the neighbours
cattle, but it came on a sore day of heavy rain, which washed
away all the white from her face and back: so the old woman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
black lady came home at night, and her rigget cow went away
with the shower and was never heard of. But Tom’s father
having some suspicion, and looking narrowly into the cows
face, found some of the chalk not washed away; and then he
gave poor Tom a hearty beating, and sent him away to seek
his fortune with a skin full of sore bones.</p>

<p class="noindent">Tom being turned to his own shifts, considers with himself
how to raise a little more money, gets a long string as near as
he could guess to be the length of his mother; and into Edinburgh
he goes, to a wright who was acquainted with his father
and mother; the wright asking him how he did? he answered
him very soberly, for he had lost a good dutiful mother; last
night, and there’s a measure of her coffin. The wright was
surprised at the news, and lamented his loss and so fell to
work on the coffin. Tom went out and stayed for some time,
and then comes in again, and tells the wright he did not know
what to do, for his father had ordered him to get money from
such a man, which he named, and that he was that day gone
out of town; the wright asked him how much he wanted? to
which he answered, a guinea and a half might do, or thirty
shillings at the least; so he gave him the guinea and the half:
then Tom gave him strict charge to be out on the morrow
against eleven o’clock with the coffin, and he should have his
money altogether; Tom set out for the alehouse with the
money, and lived while it lasted. Next morning the wright
and his two lads goes out with the coffin; and as they were
going in the house, Tom’s mother stands at the door, asking
the master how he did, and where he was going with that fine
coffin? he did not know well what to say, being so surprized
to see her alive! but at last he told her it was made designedly
for her, and that her son brought in the measure the day
before, and had got a guinea and a half from him, which he
said was to buy some other necessaries for the funeral. O the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
rogue! said she has he played me that? So the wright got
his guinea and half and so much for his trouble, and had to
take back his coffin with him again.</p>

<p>Tom being now short of money again began to think how
he would raise a fresh supply; so he went to the port amongst
the shearers, and there hires about thirty of them, and agrees
to give them a whole week’s shearing at tenpence a day, which
was twopence higher than any had got that year; this made
the poor shearers think he was an honest generous genteel
master as ever they got, so he took them all into an alehouse,
and gave them a hearty breakfast, till they could eat no more.
Now says he, when there are so many of you together perhaps
from different parts, and unacquainted with one another, I do
not know but there may be some of you honest men and some
of you rogues: and you are to lie all in one barn together,
any of you who has any mony, you’ll be safest to give it to
me, and I’ll mark it down in my book, with your names and
what I receive from each of you and you shall have it all
again on Saturday’s night when you get your wages. O!
very well good man, take mine take mine, every one
cried faster than another; some gave him five, six, seven
and eight shillings, even all they had earned through the
harvest, which amounted to near seven pounds sterling.
Having got all their money, he goes on with them
till about three miles out of the town, and coming to<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
a great field of standing corn, though some thing green,
yet convenient for this purpose, as it lay some distance from
any house or person; so he made them begin there, telling
them he was going to order dinner for them, and send is own
servants to join them: Away he goes with all the speed he
could, but takes another road into the town, lest they should
follow and catch him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Now when the people to whom the corn belonged, saw such
a band in their field, they could not understand the meaning
of it; but the goodman whose corn it was, went off crying
always as he run, to them to stop; but they would not, until
he began to strike them, and they at him, he being in a great
passion, as the corn was not fully ripe; at last, by force of
argument and other peoples coming up to them, the poor
shearers were convinced they had gotten the bite, which
caused them to go away lamenting their misfortune.</p>

<p>In two or three days thereafter as Tom was going down the
Canongate, he meets one of his shearers, who knew him and
kept fast by him demanding his money and satisfaction for all
the rest: whisht, whisht, says Tom, and you’ll get yours and
something else beside. So Tom takes him into the jail,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
calls for a bottle of ale and a dram, then takes the jaylor aside,
as if he had been to borrow the money from him: and says
to the jaylor, this man here is a great thief, I and two
others, have been in search of him these three days, and the
other two men have the warrant with them, so if you’ll keep
the rogue here till I run and bring them, you shall have a guinea
in reward: yes, said the jaylor, go and I’ll fix the rogue for
you. Tom gets clear out, leaving the poor innocent fellow and
the jaylor straggling together, and then sets off for England
directly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Tom having now left his own native country, went into the
county of Northumberland, where he hired himself with an old
miser of a farmer; and here he continued several years, performing
the duty in his service very well, though sometimes
playing a roguish trick to those about him: his master had a
very naughty custom that he would allow them no candle at
night to see with when at supper; Tom one night sets himself
next to his master, and as they were all about to fall on, Tom
puts his spoon into the midst of the dish where the crowdie
was the hottest, and claps a spoonful into his masters mouth:
a pox upon you for a rogue, cried his master, for my mouth is
all burnt; a pox upon you for a master, says Tom, for you
keep a house as dark as Purgatory, for I was going to my
own mouth with that sup and mist the way it being so dark:
don’t think master that I am such a big fool as to feed you,
while I have a mouth of my own. So from that night that Tom
burnt his master’s mouth with the hot crowdie, they always
got a candle to shew them light at supper, for his master
would feed no more in the dark while Tom was present.</p>

<p>There was a servant girl in the house, who always when she
made the beds neglected to make Tom’s, and would have him
to do it himself, well then, says Tom, I have harder work to do,
and I shall do that too, so next day when Tom was in the field
at the plough, when he saw his master coming from the house
towards him, he then left the horses and the plough standing
in the field, and goes away towards his master, who cried,
What is wrong, or is any thing broke with you? No, no, says
Tom, but I am going home to make my bed, it has not been
made these two weeks, and just now is about the time, the
maid makes all the rest, so I’ll go home and make mine too.
No, no sirrah, go back to your plough, and I’ll cause it to be
made every night to you. Then, says Tom, I’ll plough two or
three furrows more in the time.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>There was a butcher came to his master’s and bought a
fine fat calf, so Tom laid it on the horses neck before the
butcher, and when he was gone, now, says Tom, what will you
hold master, but I’ll steal that calf from the butcher before he
goes two miles off? Why, says his master, I’ll hold a guinea
you don’t; done, says Tom; in he goes, and gets a good shoe
of his master’s, and runs off another way cross the fields until
he got before the butcher: near to the corner of a hedge,
where there was an open and turning of the way, here Tom
darns himself behind the hedge, and throws the shoe in the
middle of the highway, then up comes the butcher riding and
his calf before him; hey, said he to himself, there’s a good
shoe, if I knew how to get on my calf again I would alight for
it but what signifies one without its neighbour? so off he goes
and lets it lye. Tom then slips out and takes the shoe up
again, and runs across the fields until he got in before the
butcher at another part of the hedge, about half a mile distant,
and there he throws the shoe out again in the midst of the
way; then up comes the butcher, and seeing it, says to himself,
now I shall have a pair of good shoes for the lifting: and
down he comes, lays the calf on the ground, and tying his
horse to the hedge, runs back, thinking to get the other shoe;
in which time, Tom whips up the calf and shoe, and home he
comes, demanding his wager, which his master could not deny,
being so fairly won.</p>

<p>The poor butcher returned to his horse, got only his travel
for his pains, so missing his calf, he knew not what to say or
do, but thinking it had broke the rope from about it’s feet, and
had run into the fields, the butcher spent that day in search of
it amongst the hedges and ditches, and so returned to Tom’s
master’s all night, intending to go and search farther for it
next day, giving them a tedious relation how he came to lose
it by a curs’d pair o’ shoes which he believed the devil had
dropt in his way, and now he had taken the calf and all along
with him, expressing his thankfulness that the devil was so
honest as to spare his old horse when he stole away his calf.
Next morning Tom went to work and makes a fine white face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
on the calf with chalk and water then brings it out and
sold it to the butcher, which was good diversion to his master
and other servants to see the butcher buy his own calf again:
no sooner was he gone with it, but Tom says, now master
what will you hold but I’ll steal it from him again, or he goes
two miles off? No, no, says his master, I’ll hold no more
beats with you, but I’ll give you a shilling if you do it, done
says Tom, it shall cost you no more; and away he runs a foot
through the fields, until he came in before the butcher, hard
by the place where he stole the calf from him the day before;
and here he lyes behind the hedge, and as the butcher came
past, he puts his hand on his mouth, and cries, Baw, baw, like
a calf; the butcher hearing this, swears to himself, that there
was the calf he had lost the day before, down he comes and
throws the calf he had on the ground, gets in through the
hedge in all haste, thinking he had no more to do but take it
up; but as he came in at the one part of the hedge, Tom
jumps out at another, and gets the calf on his back, then gets
in over the hedge on the other side, and through the fields he
came safely home, with the calf on his back; while the poor
butcher spent his time and labour in vain, running from hedge
to hedge, and hole to hole, seeking what was not there to be
found. So the butcher returned to his horse again, and finding
his other calf gone, he concluded it to be done by some
invisible spirit thereabout that spot of ground; and so went
home and raised a bad report on the devil, saying he was
turned a highwayman and had taken two calfs from him. So
Tom washing the white face off the stolen calf, his master sent
the butcher word to come and buy another calf, which he
accordingly did a few days after, and Tom sold him the same
calf a third time; then told him the whole affair as it was
acted, giving him his money again so the butcher got but fun
for all his fuddle.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">There was an old rich blind woman, who lived hard bye, that
had a young girl her only daughter, and she fell deep in love
with Tom, and Tom fell as deep in love with the money, but not
with the maid: the old woman bestowed a vast of presents on
Tom, and mounted him like a gentleman, but still he put off
the marriage from time to time, and always wanted something,
which the old woman gave the money to purchase for him,
until he had got about thirty pounds of her money and then
she would delay the marriage no longer: Tom went and took
the old woman and girl aside, and made his apology as follows&mdash;Dear
mother,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> said he I am very willing to wed with my
dear Polly, for she appears as an angel in mine eyes, but I am
sorry very sorry to acquaint you that I am not a fit match for
her: what child, says the old woman, there’s not a fitter match
in the world for my Polly, I did not think your country could
afford such a clever youth as what I hear of you to be,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> you
shall neither want gold nor silver, and a good horse to ride
upon and when I die you shall have my all: O but says Tom,
mother that’s no the matter at all, the stop is this, when I was
at home in Scotland, I got a stroke with a horse’s foot on the
bottom of my belly, which has quite disabled me below that I
cannot perform I husband’s duty in bed. Then the old woman
clapt her hands, and fell a crying, O! if it had been any impediment
but that, but that, but that, woful that! which gold
and silver cannot purchase and yet the poorest people that is
even common beggars have plenty off it. The old woman and
her daughter sat crying and wringing their hands, and Tom
stood and wept lest he should get no more money, O says
Polly, mother I’ll wed with him nevertheless, I love him so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
dearly? No, no, you foolish girl would you throw yourself
away to marry a man and die a maid, you don’t know the end
of your creation, it is the enjoyment of a man in bed that
makes women to marry, which is a pleasure like a paradise,
and if you wed with this man, you’ll live and die and never
know it. Hoo, hoo, says Tom, If I had got money, I needed
not been this way till now; money, you fool, said the old
woman, there’s not such a thing to be got for money in all
England: ay, says Tom, there’s a doctor in Newcastle, will
make me able as any other man for ten guineas: ten guineas,
said she, I’ll give him fifty guineas if he will, but here is twelve
and go to him directly, and know first what he can do, and
come again and wed my child, or she and I both will die for
thy sake. Tom having now got twelve guineas more of their
money, got all things ready, and next morning early, sets out
for Newcastle, but instead of going to Newcastle, he came to
old Scotland, and left Polly and her mother to think upon him,
then in about two weeks after, when he was not like to return,
no nor so much as a word from him: the old woman and Polly
got a horse, and came to Newcastle in search of him, went
through all the doctors shops asking if there came a young
man there about two weeks ago with a broken cock to mend:
some laught at her, others were like to kick her out of doors,
so the old woman had to return without getting any further
intelligence of Tom.</p>

<p>Now after Tom’s return to Scotland, he got a wife and took
a little farm near Dalkeith, and became a very douse man for
many days, followed his old business the couping of horses
and cows the feeding of veals for slaughter, and the like: He
went one day to a fair and bought a fine cow from an old
woman, but Tom judged from the lowness of the price that
the cow certainly had some fault; Tom gives the wife the
other hearty bicker of good ale, then says, he, wife the money’s
your’s and the cow’s mine, ye must tell me ony wi’ bit of faults
it she has: Indeed quoth she goodman, she has nae a fault
but ane, and in she had wanted it, I wad never a parted wi’
her; and what’s that goodwife said he? Indeed said she the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
filthy daft beast sucks ay hersel; hute, says Tom, if that be
all, I’ll soon cure her of that, O can ye do’t said she, If I had
kend what wad a done it, ye had nae gotten her. A well says
Tom I’ll tell you what to do, tak the cow’s price I gave you
just now, and tye it hard and fast in your napkin, and give it
to me throw beneath the cow’s wame, and I’ll give you the
napkin again over the cow’s back, and I’ll lay my life for it
that she’ll never suck hersel in my aught; a wat well, said she,
I’se do that an they sud be witchcraft in’t,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> so Tom no sooner
got it throw below the cow’s wame than he looses out his
money and puts it in his pocket, and gave the wife again her
napkin over the cow’s back accordingly as he told her, saying,
now wife, you have your cow and I my money, and she’ll
never suck herself in my aught, as I told you, O dole, cryed
the wife, is that your cure, ye have cheated me, ye have
cheated me.</p>

<p class="noindent">Tom being very scant of money at a time when his rent was
to pay, and though he was well acquainted with the Butchers
in Edinburgh, he tried severals of them, yet none of them would
lend him as much, he was known to be such a noted sharper.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Tom thinks with himself that he’ll give them all a bite in
general who had refused him: So in he comes next day
(and all of them had heard of a fine fat calf he had feeding)
comes to one of the butchers, and tell’s him he was going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
sell the fat calf he had at home. Well says the butcher, and
what will you have for it? just five and thirty shillings, says
Tom: No, says the butcher, by what I hear of it I’ll give
thirty. Na, na, says Tom, you must remember that is not the
price of it, but give me twenty shillings just now, and send
out your lad the morrow and we’ll perhaps agree about it.
Thus Tom went thro’ ten of them in one day, and got twenty
shillings from each of them, and kept his speech against the
law for whatever they offered him for his calf, he told them
to remember that was not to be the price of it, but give me
twenty shillings just now, and send out your lad on the morrow
morning and perhaps we’ll agree was all that passed. So
Tom came home with his ten pound, and pay’d his rent; and
early next morning one of the butcher’s sent out his <ins class="corr" id="tn-82" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'lad to Louthan'">
lad to Louthian</ins> Tom’s for a calf, and as he was about a mile from
the town, went to an ale house door and calls for a bicker of
ale, and as he was drinking it, up comes another butcher’s lad
on the same errand, he being called by the first to come and
drink, which caused another bicker; then come other two on
the same errand; again six more, which made out the ten;
and every one told he was going to Louthian Tom’s for a calf,
which made them think Tom had gathered together all the
calves in that country side: So up they comes to Tom’s house
and every one called for his calf, and his calf; and Tom had
but one calf to serve them all; which he took out and shews
them. Now, says he, whoever gives most for it shall have it,
or I’ll put it to a roup. What said they, our masters bought
it yesterday. Then says Tom, you would be fools to buy it
to day for it is heavy to carry and fashious to lead,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> you must
all go home without it; next day Tom got ten summonses,
to answer at the instance of the butchers for selling his calf
and not delivering it. Tom then goes to Edinburgh, gets the
ablest lawyer in town for that purpose, tells him the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
what past, from first to last. Then said the lawyer, as they
cannot prove a bargain, and deny the paying of the money
again, if you’ll give me the calf, I’ll bring you off; but remember
in law there is no point like that of denial. The calf, says
Tom, you’ll not want the calf, and a stone of butter to make
it ready with. Then the lawyer goes to the court, where Tom
is called upon; his lawyer answers first, who asked the butchers,
if they could tell the price of the calf, or prove the bargain?
they answered, No; but he ordered us to send out our
lads and we would agree about it? Gree about it, said the
judges! why, do you come to sue for a bargain and to gree
about it; Ay, but, said they, we want twenty shillings a piece
from him of money we gave him. Tom is called out, then
said the judge, did you borrow twenty shillings of any of these
men? Not I my lord, I came indeed asking the loan of
money from them, but they would lend me none; and then I
came next day beggar-ways, and they were so generous as to
give me twenty shillings a piece. But said the judge, were
not you to give it back again; I never promised nor never
intended at all, my lord; for what is given to the poor is given
gratis, and I appeal to this whole court that whatever pence
any of you has given to the poor that you look not for any of
it back again. Then Tom was freed at the bar, and the butchers
lost, and laughed at.</p>

<p>After the court, Tom and the lawyer had a hearty bottle;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and at parting the lawyer said, now mind Tom, and send me
the calf to-morrow. O yes, says Tom, but you must first send
me out forty shillings for it. What, says the lawyer, did not
you promise me it and a stone of butter to make it ready with,
for gaining your plea? But, says Tom, did you not tell me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
that the only point of the law was to deny? and you cannot
prove it: So I’ll sell my calf to them that will give most for
it; and if you have learned me law, I have learned you roguery
to your experience. So take this as a reward for helping me
to cheat the butchers: and I think I’m even now with you
both. And this was all the lawyer got of Tom.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">John Cheap the chapman, was a very comical short thick
fellow, with a broad face and a long nose; both lame and lazy,
and something leacherous among the lasses: he chused rather
to sit idle than work at any time, as he was a hater of hard
labour. No man needed to offer him cheese and bread after
he curst he would not have it; for he would blush at bread
and milk, when hungry, as a beggar doth at a babee. He
got the name of John Cheap the chapman, by his selling 20
needles for a penny, and twa leather laces for a farthing. He
swore no oaths but one, which was, Let me never sin.</p>

<p>He used no imprecations, But let me never cheat nor be
cheated, but rather cheat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He gave bad counsel to none but children, to burn the bonecombs,
that their mother might buy another when he came
again.</p>

<p>He never fought with any but dogs,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and the good wives
daughters in their daffing, and that’s not dangerous.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1 pfs90"><em>The following relation is taken from his own mouth,
verbatim.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">I John Cheap by chance, at some certain time, doubtless
against my will, was born at the Hottom, near Habertehoy
mill: My father was a Scots Highlandman, and my mother a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Yorkshire wench, but honest, which causes me to be of a
mongrel kind; I made myself a chapman when very young,
in great hopes of being rich when I became old; but fortune
was fickle and so was I; for I had not been a chapman above
two days, until I began to consider the deep ditches, midden
dubs, biting dogs and wiet sacks: And what comfort is it,
says I, to lye in a cows oxter, the length of a cold winter
night: to sit behind backs, till the kail be a cuttied up, and
then to lick colley’s leavings.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>My first journey was through old Kilpatrick, all the day
long I got no meat nor money until the evening, I began to
ask for lodging, then every wife to get me away, would either
give me a cogful of kail, or piece of cake. Well says I to myself,
if this be the way, I shall begin in the morning to ask for
lodging, or any time when I am hungry. Thus I continued
going from house to house, until my belly was like to burst,
and my pockets could hold no more; at last I came to a farmer’s
house, but thinking it not dark enough to prevail for
lodging, sat down upon a stone at the end of the house, till
day-light would go away out of the west; and as I was going
to get up to go in to the house, out comes the goodwife, as I
supposed her to be, and sat down at the end of the stone I
being at the other, there she began to make off her water with
full force, which I bore with, very modestly, till near an end;
then she made the wind follow with such force, as made (as I
thought) the very stone I leaned upon to move, which made
me burst out into laughter; then up gets the wife, and runs
for it; I followed hard after into the house, and as I entered
the house, I heard the goodman, saying, Ay, ay, goodwife,
What’s the haste, you run so?</p>

<p>No more passed, until I addressed myself to the goodman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
for quarters; which he answered, “Indeed lad, we hae nae
beds but three, my wife and I, our sells twa, and the twa bits
a little anes, Willie and Jenny lies in ane, the twa lads our twa
servant men Willie Black and Tam, lies in anither, and auld
Mags my mither, and the lass Jean Tirram lies the gither, and
that fills them a’.” O but says I, Goodman, there is some of
them fuller than others, you may let me lie with your mither
and the lass; I shall ly heads and thraws wi’ them, and keep
on my breeks. A good keep me, quo’ the lass, frae a’ temptations
to sin, altho’ thou be but a callen, heth I’ll rather ly wi’
Sannock Garner. No, no, cries the goodwife, he’s no be here
the night. Dear good-wife, said I, what ails you at me? a
d&mdash;l be here, an’ ye be here the night, said she; ho, ho, said I,
but I’m here first, and first com’d first serv’d, good-wife; but
an’ the ill thief be a friend of your’s, you’ll have room for him
too. Ye thief like widdyfu’, said she, are ye evening me to be
sib to the foul thief; it’s weel kend I am come of good honest
fouks: It may be so goodwife, said I, but ye look rather the
other way, when ye would lodge the d&mdash;l in your house and
ca’ out a poor chapman to die, such a stormy night as this.
What do ye say! says she, there was na a bonnier night since
winter came in nor this. O goodwife, what are you saying!
Do ye not mind, when you and I was at the east end of the
house, such a noise of wind and water was then; a wae worth
the filthy body, said she, is not that in every part. What said
the goodman, a wat well there was nae rain when I came in:
The wife then shuts me out, and bolted the door behind me:
Well, said I, but I shall be through between thy mouth and
thy nose or the morrow. It being now so dark, and I a stranger,
could see no place to go to, went into the corn yard, but finding
no loose straw I fell a drawing one of their stacks, sheaf
by sheaf, until I pulled out a threave or two, and got into the
hole myself, where I lay as warm as a pye; but the goodman
in the morning, perceiving the heap of corn sheaves, came
running to carry it away, and stop up the hole in the stack
wherein I lay, with some of the sheaves, so with the steighling
of the straw, and him cursing the thieves who had done it: I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
then skipping out of the hole, ho, ho, said I, goodman, you’re
not to bury me alive in your stack: He then began to chide
me, vowing he would keep my pack for the damage I had
done: whereupon, I took his servants witnesses he had robbed
me; when hearing me urge him so, he gave me my pack
again, and off I came to the next house, where I told the
whole story.</p>

<p>My next exploit was near Carluke, between Hamiltown and
Lanerk: Where on a cold stormy night, I came to a little
town with four or five houses in it; I went twice through it,
but none of them would give me the credit to stand all night
among their horse, or yet to ly in their cow’s oxter: At last I
prevailed with a wife, if her husband was willing, to let me
stay, if he was not against it, to which he answered, “If I
should ly in his midden-dib, I should get no quarters from him
that night; a wheen lazy idle villains rins a to be chapman,
comes through the country fashing fouks, ay seeking quarters;
the next day ye’ll be gaun wi’ a powder’d pirrewig, and a watch
at your arse, and winna let fouk stand afore your chop doors,
ye’ll be sae saucy.”</p>

<p>After hearing my sentence from the goodman, expecting no
relief but to ly without, yet I perceived when he came out of
the barn, he only drew too the door behind him: So when he
was gone, I slipt into the barn, and by help of one of the
kiples, climbs up the mou, and there dives down among the
sheaves, and happed myself all over, so that I lay as warm as
the goodman himself. But in the morning long before day,
two fellows came into the barn, and fell a threshing, that by
their disturbance I could sleep no more; at last I got up with
all my hair hanging over my face, and when he that stood on
the opposite side perceived me, I made my eyes to roll, and
wrayed my face in a frightful manner, so that the poor fellow
supposed he had seen the deil, or something as ill, gave a rore
as if he had been sticked, and out at the door he runs; the
other following after him crying, Wa’ Johny man, what did
you see? O! Sandy, Sandy, the deil’s on the tap o’ the mou’,
sheavling his mouth at me; I’ll not be so well this month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
man, my heart’s out o’ its hole, wou but yon be a fearfu’ like
fake indeed, it would fright ony living creature out o’ their
senses.</p>

<p>I hearing the fear they were in, cried unto them not to
be frighted, for I was not the deil, but a poor chapman who
could not get quarters last night a foul fa’ thy carcase sir, for
our Jock is through the midden-dib, dirt and a’ the gither;
he who went last came again, but the other man ran into
the house, and told what he had seen: The goodman and his
wife came running, he with a grape in his hand, and her with
the Bible,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the one crying Sandy, Sandy, is’t true that the deil
was in the barn; Na, na, said he, it’s but a chapman, but poor
Jock has gotten a fright wi’ him. They laughed heartily at
the sport, took me in to breakfast, and by this time poor
Johnny was gone to bed.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>After this I travelled up the water of Clyde, near the foot
of Tintock-hill, where I met with a sweet companion, who was
an older traveller than I, who gave me more information how
to blow the goodwife, and sleek the goodman, with him I kept
company for two months, and as we travelled down Tweed
towards the border we being both hungry and could get
nothing to buy for the belly, we came unto a wife who had
been kirning, but she would give us nothing, nor sell so much
as one halfpenny’s worth of her sour milk; Na, na, said she,
I’ll neither sell butter, bread or milk, it’s a’ little enough to sair
my ain family: ye that’s chapman may drink water, ye dinna
work sair. Ay, but goodwife, said I, I hae been at Temple-bar,
where I was sworn ne’er to drink water, if I could get
better: What do ye say, said she, about Temple-bar? A town
just about twa three mile and a bittock frae this: A thief
ane was to swear there, an’ it wasna’ auld Willie Miller the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
cobler, the ill thief a neither minister nor magistrate ever was
in’t a’.</p>

<p>O but says the other lad, the Temple-bar he means by is at
London. Yea, yea, lad, an ye be cum’d frae London ye’re no
muckle worth, for the fouks there awa, is a’ witches and warlocks,
deils, brownies and fairies.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> We’ll a wat that is true,
said I, and that thou shalt know, thou hard hearted wretch,
who would have people to starve or provoke them to steal.
With that I rose and lifts twa or three long straws, and casting
knots on them, into the byre I went and throws a knotted
straw to every cows stake, saying, Thy days shall not be long:
The wife followed, wringing her hands, earnestly praying for
herself and all that was hers. I then came out at the door,
and lifted a stone, running three times round about, and
threw it over the house,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> muttering some words, which I knew
not myself, and concluding with these words, “Thou Monsieur
Diable,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> brother to Beelzebub god of Ekron, take this wife’s
kirn, butter and milk, sap and substance, without and within,
so that she may die in misery, as she would have others to
live.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The wife hearing the aforsaid sentence, clapt her hands, and
called out another old woman as foolish as herself, who came
crying after us to come back, back we went, when she made
us eat heartily of butter and cheese; then she earnestly
pleaded with me to go and lift my cantrups, which I did, upon
her promising never to deny a hungry traveller meat nor
drink, whether they had money to pay for’t or not: and never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
to serve the poor with the old proverb, Go home to your own
parish;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but give them less or more, as ye see them in need.
This faithfully she promisee to do while she lived, and with
milk, we drank towards her cow’s health and her own, not forgetting
her husband and the bull’s, as the one was goodman
of the house, and the other of the byre; and away we came in
all haste, lest some of a more understanding nature should
come to hear of it, and follow after us.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>In a few days thereafter we came to an ale-house in a moor,
far distant from any other, it being a sore day of wind and
rain, we could not travel therefore was obliged to stay there,
and the house being very throng, we could get no bed but the
servant lasses, which we was to have for a pennyworth of pins
and needles, and she was to ly with her master and mistress:
But as we were going to bed, in comes three Highland drovers
on their way home from England; the landlord told them
that the beds were all taken up but one, that two chapmen
was to ly in; one of them swore, his broad sword should fail
him, if a chapman lay there that night. They took our bed,
and made us sit by the fire all night: I put on a great many
peats, and when the drovers were fast asleep, I put on a big
brass pan full of water, and boiled their brogs therein, for the
space of half an hour, then lays them as they were, every pair
by themselves; so when they rose, every one began to chide
another, saying, “Hup, pup, ye sheing a brog,” for not one of
them would serve a child of ten years of age, being so boil’d
in, the landlord persuaded them that their feet was swelled
with their hard traveling, being so wet last night, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
would go on well enough if they had travelled a mile or two.
Now the Highlandmen laught at me the night before, when
they lay down in the bed I was to have; but I laught as much
to see them all three trot away in the morning with their
boil’d brogs in their hands.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="hjc-II">
<h3><span class="smcap lsp2">Part II.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We came again to a place near Sutry-hill, where the ale was
good, and very civil usage, and our drought being very great
the more we drank, the better we lov’d it: and here we fell in
company with a quack doctor, who bragged us with bottle
about, for two days and two nights, only when one fell drunk,
we pushed and pricked him with a big prin, to keep him from
sleeping. He bought of our hair, and we of his pills and
drugs, he having as much knowledge of the one, as we had of
the other, only I was sure, I had as much as would set a whole
parish to the midden or mug, all at once.</p>

<p>But at last our money ran short, and the landlady had no
chalk nor faith to credit us seeing by our coats, courage, and
conduct, that we would little mind performance against the
day of payment, so then we began to turn sober and wise
behind the hand, and every one of us to seek supply from
another, and when we collected all the money we had amongst
us, on the table, it was but fourpence halfpenny, which we
lovingly divided among us, but only three babees a piece, and
as Drouthy Tom’s stock and mine was conjunct, we gave the
quack again his sh&mdash;&mdash;g stuff and stinking drugs, and he gave
us our goods and hair, which we equally divided betwixt us,
the whole of it only came to eighteen shillings and sixpence
prime cost, and so we parted; I went for East Lothian, and
Tom for the West; but my sorting of goods being very unsuitable
for that country, I got but little or no money, which
caused me to apply to the goodman for to get lodging, and it
being upon a Saturday’s night was hard to be found till very
late in the night. I prevailed to get staying in a great farmers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
house, about two miles from Haddington; they were all at
supper when I went in; I was ordered to sit down behind
their backs, the goodwife then took a dish, went round the
servants, and collected a soup out of every cog,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> which was
sufficient to have served three men; the goodwife ordered me
to be laid in the barn all night for my bed, but the bully-fac’d
goodman swore he had too much stuff in it, to venture me
there, the goodwife said I should not ly within the house, for
I would be o’er near the lasses bed, then the lads swore I
should not go with them,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> for I was a forjesket like fellow,
and (wha kens whether I was honest or not) he may fill his
wallet wi’ our cloaths and gang his wa’ or day light. At last
I was conducted out to the swine’s stye, to sleep with an old
sow and seven pigs, and there I lay for two nights<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In the
night the young pigs came gruzling about me very kindly,
thinking I was some friend of their mother’s come to visit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
them; they gave me but little rest, always coming kissing me
with their cold noses, which caused me to beat them off with
my staff, which made them to make a terrible noise, so that
their old mother came up to argue the matter, running upon
me with open mouth, but I gave her such a rout over her
long snout, which caused her to roar out murder in her own
language that alarmed the servants where they lay, who
came to see what was the matter, I told them, their old sow
was going to swallow me up alive, bid them to go and bring
her meat, which they did, and the brute became peaceable.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath morning I came into the house, the goodman
asked me if I could shave any, yes, said I, but never did
on the Sabbath-day. I fancy, said he, you are some Westland
Whig?<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Said I, you may suppose me to be what you
think proper to day, but yesternight you used me like a Tory,
when you sent me into a stye to ly in your sow’s oxter, who
is a fitter companion for a devil, than any human creature, the
abominablest brute upon the earth, said I, who was forbidden
to be eaten under the law, and cursed under the gospel<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>: Be
they curs’d or be they bless’d said he, I wish I had anew of
them; but an’ ye will not tak aff my beard, ye’s get nae meat
here the day; then said I, if you will give me meat and drink
for money, until the Sabbath be past, I’ll take on my wallat,
and go along with you to the kirk, and tell your minister how
you used me as a hog. No said the goodwife, you shall not
want your crowdie man. But my heart being full of sorrow
and revenge, a few of them sufficed me.</p>

<p>On the morning I went into the house, the goodman ordered
me the pottage pot to lick, for, says he it is an old property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
to chapmen. Well I had no sooner begun to it, then out
came a great big mastiff dog from below the bed, and grips
me by the breast, then turns me over upon my back, and takes
the pot himself; Ay, ay, said the goodman I think your
brother pot-licker and you cannot agree about your breakfast?
A well said I, goodman, you said that pot-licking was a chapman’s
property, but your dog proves the contrary: So away
I comes and meeting the goodwife at the door, bids her farewel
for ever; but what said I is your husband’s name? to
which she answered, John Swine, I was thinking so, said I, he
has such dirty fashions: but whether was yon his mother or
his sister, I lay with these two nights.</p>

<p>All that day I travelled the country west from Haddington,
but could get no meat; when I asked if they had any to
sell, they told me, they never did sell any bread, and I found
by sad experience, they had none to give for nothing. I came
unto a little country village, and went through it all, house
after house, and could get neither bread nor ale to buy; At
last I came to a poor weavers house, and asked him if he
could lend me a hammer? Yes, said he, What are you going
to do with it? Indeed said I, I am going to knock out all
my teeth with it, for I can get no bread to buy in all this
country, for all the stores and stacks you have in it: What
said he, was you in the minister’s? I know not said I, does
he keep an ale-house? O na, said he, he preaches every Sunday:
and does he preach, said I? is it to harden your hearts?
haud well together? have no charity? hate strangers? hunger
the poor? eat and drink all yourselves? better burst your bellies
then give it to beggars, or let good meat spoil<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>: if your
minister be as naughty as his people, I’m positive he’ll drive
a louse to London for the hide and tallow. Here I bought
the weaver’s dinner for twopence, and then set out again,
keeping my course westward. It being now night, I came to
a farmer’s house south from Dalkieth, the goodman being
very civil, and desirous of news, I related the whole passages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
of two days and nights by-past; whereat he was greatly
diverted, and said, I was the first he heard of, that ever
that man gave quarters to before, though he was an elder of
the parish. So the goodman and I fell so thick, that he
ordered me to be laid on a shake down bed beyond the fire,
where I lay more snug than among the swine.</p>

<p>Now there was three women lying in a bed in the same
apartment, and they not minding that I was there, first one of
them rose and let her water go in below the chimney-grate,
where I had a perfect view of her bonny-thing, as the coal-fire
burnt so clearly all the night, then another rose and did the
same, last of all got up the old matron, as she appear’d to be,
like a second-handed goodwife, or a whirl’d o’er maiden, six
times overturned, and as she let her dam go, she also with full
force, when done, let a fart like the blast of a trumpet, which
made the dust on the hearth-stone to fly up like mist about
her arse, whereat I was forc’d to laugh out, which made her
run for it, but to smother the laughter I stapt the blankets in
my mouth; she went to bed and waken’d the other two saying,
O dole! what will I tell you? yon chapman has seen a’
our a&mdash;ses the night; shame fa’ him, said they, for we had nae
mind he was there: I wat well, says one of them, I’se no rise
till he be awa’, but said the old woman, gin he has seen mine,
I cannot help it, it’s just like other folks, and fin’t a hair care
I. In the morning the old matron got up first and ordered
up the house, then told me to rise now for chapmen and every
body was up, then she asked me if I had an use of laughing
in my sleep? Yes, said I, when I see any daft like thing I
can look and laugh at it, as well sleeping as walking; A good
preserve us, said she, ye’re an unco body, but ye needna wait
on our porridge time, I’se gie you cheese and bread in your
pouch, which I willingly accepted, and away I came.</p>

<p>Then I kept my course west by the Pentland hills, where I
got plenty of hair,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> good and cheap, besides a great quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
of old brass, which was an excellent article to make my little
pack seem big and weighty. Then I came into a little country
village, and going in by the side of the house, there was a
great big cat sitting in a weaver’s window, beiking herself in
the sun, and washing her face with her feet: I takes her a
civil nap on the nose, which made her turn back in through
the window, and the weaver having a plate full of hot pottage
in the innerside to cool, poor badrons ran through the middle
of them, burnt her feet, and threw them all to the ground, ran
thro’ the house, crying fire and murder in her own language,
which caused the weary wicked webster to come running to
the door, where he attacked me in a furious rage, and I to
avoid the first shock, fled to the top of the midden, where
endeavouring to give me a kick, I catched him by the foot,
and tumbled him back over into the dirty midden dub,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> where
both his head and shoulders went under dirt and water; but
before I could recover my elwand or arms, the wicked wife
and her twa sons was upon me in all quarters, the wife hung
in my hair, while the two sons boxed me about and before,
and being thus over-powered by numbers, I was fairly beat of
by this wicked webster, his troops being so numerous.</p>

<p>The same day as I was going up to a country house, I met
on the way a poor beggar wife with a boy, who was both of
them bitten in different places by a big mastiff dog, they persuaded
me to turn back, but I said I should first see him: so
up I goes to the side of a hedge, and cuts a long bramble full
of prickles, which I carried in my left hand, with my sturdy
staff in the right; and as I came near the house, Mr. Youffer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
came roaring upon me like a lion, he being a tyke of such a
monstrous size, frighted me so that I ran back; but he pursued
me so hard, I was forced to face about, and holding out
the briar to him, which he gripped in his mouth, and then I
stripped it through his mouth, and gave him a hearty blow
upon his ear with my rung, which made him go tumbling to
his master’s door, and when he got up he could not fight any,
his mouth being so full of prickles by the biting of the briar,
which caused him go about yuling and rubbing his mouth with
his foot, the people of the house came running to bite me, but
my briar had bitten him; they then called him in, and fell to
picking the pricks out of his tongue.</p>

<p class="noindent">I travelled then west by Falkirk, by the foot of the great
hills; and one night after I had got lodging in a farmer’s
house, there happened a contest between the goodman and
his mother, he being a young man unmarried, as I understood,
and formerly their sowens had been that thin, so the goodman
being a sworn birley-man<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of that barony, came to
survey the sowens before they went on the fire, and actually
swore they were o’er thin, and she swore by her conscience
they would be thick enough if ill hands and ill een<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> baed
awa’ from them: A sweet be here mither, said he, do ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
think that I’m a witch? Witch here or witch there, said the
wife, swearing by her saul, and that was nae banning, she said
they’ll be good substantial meat, a’ what say ye chapman?
indeed goodwife, said I, sowens is but saft meat at the best;
but if ye make them thick enough, and put a good lump of
butter in them, they’ll do very well for a supper: I true sae
lad, said she, ye hae some sense; so the old woman put on the
pot with her sowens, and went to milk her cows, leaving me to
steer; the goodman her son, as soon as she went out, took a
great cog full of water and put it into the pot amongst the
sowens, and then went out of the house, and left me alone: I
considered what sort of a pish the bed supper I was to get if
I staid there, I thought to set out, but takes up the pitcher
with water, and fills up the pot until it was running over,
and then takes up my pack and comes about a mile farther
that night, leaving the honest woman and her son, to sup their
watery witch’t sowens at their own leisure.</p>

<p>I then turned towards the east, through a place called
Slamanen, and was lodged one night near a place called Tod’s
bughts, where there was a boul-horn’d goodwife, but a very
civil goodman, when I went in, she took up a dish from the
dog wherein was a few he had left, and with a collection more
from other cogs, she offered them to me, which I refused, ’m,
said she, ye’re a lordly sort of a chapman indeed; so I began
to divert the goodman, by telling him a deal of fine stories to
make him laugh, but could not get near the fire, at last said,
O goodwife, I’ll tell you news; ay, chapman, what’s that, said
she? indeed my feet’s very cauld, said I, whereat they all
laught but the goodwife, she gloom’d until the rest was done,
and then took a laugh at it herself: So the goodman ordered
the Johnies, Jamies and Jennies with their wheels to sit
about; then I was set beyond the fire, and preferred to steer
their sowens, but when they were ready and put up in dishes,
the goodwife order’d one of the lads to take a pair of old
blankets and two sacks, and shew me where I was to ly in the
barn: Ho, ho, thinks I, there’s no supper for me, but I’ll
remember this, to pay her stock and annual. So I went to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
barn and lay till next morning, about Chapman’s rising time,
when pottage was ready, and then gives the wife a fine cotton
lace and a few pins, which pleased her so well, that she went
through the cogs and collected about a mutchkin of pottage
for me, for which I thanked her: “Awat well lad, said she, an
ye be coming buy ony time, ye’s be welcome to a night o’ our
barn, for ye hae na steal’d naething,” thanks to you goodwife,
said I, that’s very fair; “Indeed lad ’tis no every ane we’ll
trust wi’ our new barn, farfore sud we?” O goodwife, it wad
be a great thief that wad run awa’ wi’ a barn on his back I
wonder ye let it stand out all night: Hute awa’ ye daft body,
how can we get it in, ke awa’ chapman ye’re joking me now.</p>

<p>I then took a turn round the country for two weeks, and
then came back to be avenged on the naughty wife and her
sowens, it being very dark or I came in, the goodwife did not
know me, but made her speech as follows: “Indeed, says she,
ye’s no be here, for there is so many thieves and robbers gawn
a-thort the kintry, an our goodman’s no at hame; is thou
honest enough?” I can want nothing of my honesty goodwife;
but did you ever see any people gawn thro’ the country,
telling they were thieves? “Na, a wat well no, said she.”
Then, said I, I’m sure I did not take away your barn on my
back the last time I was here; “Yee lad, said she, are ye the
chapman that cracket sae well to our goodman? come in by,
ye’s get a night o’ the barn yet;” thanks to you goodwife and
we sud get nae mair. I then being preferred to my old seat
and got the sowens to steer, until they were near ready, when
the goodwife ordered the lad to take the old blankets, and
shew me to my bed in the barn; I then gave the sowens their
last turn, and having about the bigness of a nut of C&mdash;l S&mdash;p,
drops it into the pot, then went off to bed in the barn as fast
as I could, and made fast both the doors within, lest the
bewitched sowens out of the pot should attack me in my
sleep: Next morning when I came in, the goodwife began to
pray for herself and all that she had, saying, “It’s Wednesday
thro’ a’ the warld and good be between you and me chapman,
for ye’re either a witch or a warlock, or something that’s no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
canny, for ye witch’t our sowens last night, for they gaed mad,
rag’d out o’ the pot, belling and bizing like barm, I thought
they wad run out to the barn to you, see how they fill’d up my
milk tub, and a’ the dishes in the house is fu’ o’ them.” Dear
goodwife, said I, they were very good when I left them, tho’ I
did not prie them, and wish’d them as much good of them as
I got, but certainly they’re not witcht, but a blessing in them,
when they are so multiplied: “Gae awa, cried she, in a passion,
ye’re no canny, ye’se ne’er be here again:” I need not
value that, said I, for I have nothing to thank you for, but my
dinner, supper, and breakfast, and for a night o’ your barn, I’ll
pay it when I come back: “Ay, ay, said she, ye need nae thank
me for what ye did not get:” that’s not my fault goodless
good, said I, prosperity to you and your witcht sowens.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The next little town I came to, and the first house which I
entered, the wife cried out, “plague on your snout sir, ye filthy
blackguard chapman like b&mdash;h it ye are, the last time ye came
here ye gard our Sandy burn the good bane kame it I gade a
sax pence in Falkirk, ay did ye, and sae did ye, and sae did
ye een, and said, ye wad gie him a muckle clear button to do
it:” Me, said I, I never had ado with you all the days of my
life, and do not say that Sandy is mine: “A wae wirth the
body am I saying ye had ado wi’ me, I wadna hae ado wi’ the
like o’ you nor I am sure wi’ them I never saw.” But what
about the button and the bane kame goodwife? Sannock is
na this the man? Ay is’t cried the boy, gie me my button,
for I burnt the kame, and she paid<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> me for’t, Gae awa’ sir, said
I, your mother and you is but mocking me; it was either you
or ane like you, or some ither body. O goodwife, I mind wha’
it is now, it’s ane just like me, when ye see the taen ye see the
tither, they ca’ him Jock Jimpither: A wae worth him quo’
the wife, if I winna thrapple him for my good bane comb.
Now said I, good wife be good, bridle your passion, and buy a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
bane comb and colour’d napkin, I’ll gie you a whaken penny-worth
will gar you sing in your bed, If I should sell you the
tae half, and gift you the tither, and gar you pay for every
inch of it sweetly or a’ be done: Hech man, said she, ye’re a
hearty fallow, and I hae need o’ a’ these things, for our Sannock’s
head is a’ hotchen, and our John’s is little better, for
an’ let them alane but ae eight days, they’ll grow as grit as
grosets. And here I sold a bone comb and a napkin, for she
believed such a douse lad as I, had no hand in making her
boy burn the bone comb.</p>

<p>The next house I came into, there was a very little taylor,
sitting on a table like a t&mdash;d on a truncher, with his legs plet
over other, made me imagine he was a sucking three footed
taylor, first I sold him a thimble, and then he wanted needles,
which I showed him one paper after another, he looking their
eyes and trying their nebs in his sleeve, dropt the ones he
thought proper on the ground between his feet, where he sat
in a dark corner near the fire, thinking I would not perceive
him: O, said he, them needles of yours is not good man, I’ll
no buy any of them, I do no not think you need, said I, taking
them out of his hand, and lights a candle was standing
near by, come, said I, sit about you thieving dog till I gather
up my needles, gathers up ten of them, come said he, I’ll buy
twal-penny’s worth of them, since I troubled you sae muckle;
no, said I, you lazie dog, I’ll sell you none, if there’s any on
the ground, seek them up and stap them in a beast’s a&mdash;se,
but if ye were a man I would burn thee in the fire, tho’ it
be in your own house, but as your a poor taylor and neither
man nor boy, I’ll do nothing but expose you for what you
are. O dear honest chapman, cried his wife, ye mauna do
that and I’ll gie you cheese and bread. No, no, you thieves,
I’m for nothing but vengeance; no bribes, for such: So as I
was lifting my pack, there was a pretty black cat which I
spread over with my napkin, and took the four corners in my
hand, carrying her as a bundle, untill I came about the middle
of the town, then provoking the dogs to an engagement with
me, so that there came upon me four or five collies, then I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
threw the poor taylor’s cat in the midst of them, there a terrible
battle ensued for some time, and badrons had certainly
died on the field had I not interposed, and got her off mortally
wounded; the people who saw the battle, alarmed the
taylor, and he sallied out like a champion with his elwand in
his hand, go back, said I, you lousie dog, or I’ll tell about the
needles, at which word he turned about. I went to an ale-house
to get some breakfast, there they asked me where I was
all night, as it was usual for chapmen to get meat where
they lodged, I told where it was, but would take none of
their meat, they seem to me not to be canny, for this morning
they were making ropes of cold sowens to crown their stacks
wi: Gae awa’, cried the wife, I cannot believe it. Die in your
ignorance for me: The wife sent away her son to see if it was
so, but or he came back I set out, and travelled down the side
of a water called Evan: and as I was coming past a mill dam,
there was a big clownish fellow lifting a pitcher of water out
of the dam, so as he dipt it full and set down on the ground,
staring at me, he tumbled in himself out of sight o’er head and
ears, and as soon as he got out, I said, Yo ho friend, Did you
get the fish? What an’ a fish ye b&mdash;h, O said I, I thought ye,
seen a fish, when you jumped in to make it jump out: What a
d&mdash;l sir, are you mocking me? runs round his pitcher, and
gives me a kick on the a&mdash;se, so that I fell designedly on his
pitcher, and tumbling it down the bank, went in pieces, his
master and another man looking and laughing at us, the poor
fellow complained of me to him, but got no satisfaction.</p>

<p>The same evening, as I was going towards the town of Linlithgow,
meets an old crabet fellow riding upon an old glaied
mare, which he always was a threshing upon with his stick:
Goode’en to you goodman, said I, are you going to the bull
wi’ your mare? What do ye say sir, they gang to the bull wi’
a cow ye brute. O yes goodman, ye are right, said I, but how
do they call that he beast that rides on the mare’s back, they
ca’t a cusser sir, a well then goode’en to you Master Cusser.
He rides a little bit, then turns back in a rage, saying, I say
sir, your last words are war nor your first, he comes then at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the flight to ride me down, but I struck his beast on the face,
and in the short turn about it fell, yet or I got my pack to the
ground, he cutted me on the head at the first stroke, and then
getting clear of the pack, played it away for some time, till by
blows on the face, I made him blood at both mouth and nose;
then he cried out, chapman, we are baith daft, for we’ll kill
oursells and make nothing o’t, we had better gree, with all my
heart, said I, and what will ye buy? nothing but a pair of
beard sheers, said he, and give me them cheap, so I sold him
a pair of sheers for three half-pence, and gave him a needle,
then parted good friends after the battle was over.</p>

<p>So I went to Linlithgow that night, where I met with
Drouthy Tom my dear companion, and here we had a most
terrible encounter with the tipenny for two nights and a day,
and then we set out for Fife on the hair order, by way of
Torryburn and Culross and coming up to a parcel of women
washing by a water side, I buys one of their hairs, the time I
was cutting it off, Tom fell a courting and kissing a girl among
them, but she fell to crying against him, saying ye have put
your hands a-tween my feet; cries an old wife, mony a ane
has taen me by there, and I ne’er said a word about it, a-wheen
daft jades, canna ye had your tongues whan its to your shame
ye speak; gae wa’, cried the lass the filthy body at he is, the
last chapman that kist me had a horse-pack, but he’ll hae naething
in his but a whisp of strae, some auld breeks, hare skins,
maukin skins, ony thing that fills the bag and bears bouk, and
yet he would kiss and handle me, hech I was made for a better
fallow, ane of them came by ae day, and sell’d our Meg
twa ell and a quarter o’ linnen to be her bridal sark, for he
had nae mair, and when she made it, and put it on, it wadna
hide her hech, hech, he.</p>

OF LEPER THE TAYLOR.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap lsp2">Part I.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Leper’s father lived in a village about six miles from Glasgow,
and died when Leper was but very young, he left a widow and
three children, two daughters and a son, and Leper being the
youngest, was greatly idolized by his mother, who was a good
soft natured woman, very industrious, and followed the business
of bleaching of cloth.</p>

<p>As Leper grew up, he turned a very mischievous boy, playing
tricks on the neighbourhood, such as tying cats to dogs-tails,
breaking hen’s legs, stoping people’s lumbs or chimney-tops;
so that his poor mother was sadly vex’d with complaints
against him.</p>

<p>To get him kept from mischief, she prevailed with a taylor
to take him an apprentice, he settled and was very peaceable
for some time, until he had got so much of the trade on his
finger-ends as he might pass for a journey-man, and then he
was indifferent whether he stayed with his master or not; his
mistress gave him but very little meat when they wrought at
home, so he loved best to be in other houses, where he got
both meat and diversion.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>Leper being resolved on revenge against his mistress, for
her thin kail, no kitchen and little bread; for tho’ flesh was
boiled in the pot, none for poor Leper and his master, but a
little bit on Sabbaths, and all the bones were kept, and put in
the pot, to make the broth thro’ the week. Leper perceived
always when she took off the pot, she turned her back to them
and took out the flesh, and set it on a shelf within her own bed;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
one night after work, he steals out a pan, cuts a piece of flesh
out of a dead horse, then goes to a lime kiln and boils it; next
day his master being from home, his landlady and him being
in the house, after she had set off the pot as usual, and taken
out her bit of good beef, he goes out for some time, and then
comes in, saying, The minister’s lass is wanting you to
go directly and speak to her mistress, away she goes in all
haste, Leper runs and takes away her bit of good beef, and
lays down his horse-flesh, and knowing she would soon return
in a passion, and sit down with a sosse in her cushion’d chair
as she used, he takes a large prin and staps it straight up
through the cushion, with its head on the chair and the point
to her back-side: in she comes in a rage, and down she sits
with all her weight on the prin point, and she roars out,
Murder, murder, for she was sticket through the a&mdash;se, the
neighbours came running in, and Leper got out with his bit of
good beef, leaving the wives to doctor his landlady’s doup as
they pleased; he still denied the doing of it, and his master
believed it might happen accidentally, but the Houdie was
very often to be had before the hole was got heal again; and
his landlady by eating of that horse-beef, took a loathing at
flesh, so Leper and his master got all the beef to eat ever after,
and his landlady turned one of the kindest mistresses a prentice
could wish for.</p>

<p>There was a neighbour wife on which Leper used to play
tricks sometimes, for which she came and complained to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
master, and got him severely beaten<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> several times: Leper
resolved to be revenged on her, so one day he came to the
back-side of her house, (no body being within but herself) and
took up a big stone, and runs it along the rough wall with all
his force, which roared like thunder in the inside of the house,
and frightened the wife so, that she thought the house was
tumbling down about her ears, upon which she ran out and
sat down at a distance, looking when the house would fall
down, till her husband came home, to whom she told the
above story, ‘Hout daft Taupie, said he, the house will stand
these hundred years,’ so by his persuasion they both went into
the house, Leper (knowing they were both in) comes back
and plays the same trick over again, which frighted the goodman
also so much, that he cried out, ‘Run Maggy run, for my
heart plays a’ pitty patty,’ and they would not lodge in the
house any more, till the masons convinced them of its sufficiency.</p>

<p>There was another neighbour who had a snarling curr dog,
which bit Leper’s leg; Leper resolved to be revenged on the
dog, and so, one night he catches the dog and carries him to
the kirk, where the rope of the bell hang upon the outside, so
with his garter he tied the dog’s fore-foot to the rope, and left
him hanging; the dog struggling to get free, set the bell a
ringing, which alarmed the whole village, every one cried out,
‘Wonderful sirs! Wonderful sirs!<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the de’il is ringing the
bell.’ When they saw the black colley hanging the rope, I
true it set the minister and all the people to their prayers:<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
but Leper fearing he would be found out by his garter, came
to the minister’s side and asked the reverend gentleman, what
was the matter? Indeed my bairn (said he) it’s the de’il ringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the kirk-bell; says Leper, I’ll go and see him, for I never saw the
de’il; the minister cry’d, Stop that mad laddie, but Leper ran
and loused the dog, crying, It’s such a man’s dog, which had
the rope in his teeth, they all cried out, ‘The de’il is in the dog,
the de’il is in the dog,’ took up some stones and fell’d poor
colley, and the de’il got the blame of making the dog ring the
bell, this spread Leper’s fame for being one of the wisest
and most couragious taylors that was in all the kingdom; and
many shaking their heads, said, ‘It was a pity he was a taylor,
but a captain or general of an army, as the devil could not
fear him.’</p>

<p>After this a farmer in the neighbourhood, hearing the fame
of Leper, how he had frighted the de’il frae being a bell-man,
sent for him to an ale-house, and drank with him very heartily,
and told him he was sadly born down with the spirit of jealousy
against his wife, on suspicion of being too free with a servant-lad
she had before, and if he would keep it secret, and learn
him how to find it out, he would give his mother a load of
meal, to which Leper and him agrees, so he gave the poor
supposed cockold instructions how to behave. So home he
goes and feigns himself to be very sick, and every day worse
and worse, taking death to him, blesses his three small children,
and charges his wife not to marry until his children
could do something for themselves: This hypocritical woman
takes the roaring, a-ha, marry, she would never marry! No,
no, there should never man ly by her side, nor kiss her lips
after thee, my lamb Johnny&mdash;&mdash;Then he acted the dying man
as well as possibly he could, the neighbours were called in, and
he’s fair o’erseen<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> as the old saying is, Before good neighbours;
the sorrowful widow made a sad lament, wrung her hands, and
tearing her hair,&mdash;&mdash;the reverend women<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> about began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
dress the corpse, asked her for a shirt, ay, ay, said she, He
has twa new linen sarks, and there is an auld ane in the
bottom of the kist it nae body can wear, just take it, ony
thing is good enough for the grave; well, said they, we must
have some linen for a winding sheet, a’well, co’ she, I ha’
twa cut o’ linen in the kist, but there is a pair of auld linen
sheets hol’d in the mids, may do well enough, I had need
to be carefu’, I’m a poor widow the day, wi’ three sma’ bairns.
Awell, the corpse is dress’d, and laid on the top of a big
chest, while the neighbours sat by her condoling her misfortune,
and wondering how the funeral raisins were to be provided;
said one, the coffin must be seen about first. Ay, ay,
said she, he has some new deals in the barn he bought to mak
a bed o’, but we’ll no break them, there is the auld barn-door
and the chaff-kist will do well enough, ony thing’s good enough
to gang to the grave; but O, co’ she, send for Sandy my
honest auld servant, and he’ll see every thing right done, I’ll
tell him where he’ll get siller to do ony thing wi’, he’s the lad
it will not see me wrang’d; then Sandy comes wrying his
face and rubbing his eyes, O Sandy, there is a sad alteration
here, and ba-a-a she cries like a bitten calf, O sirs, will ye gang
a’ butt the house till I tell Sandy what to do; butt they goes,
and there she fell a kissing of Sandy, and said, Now my dear,
the auld channering ghaist is awa,’ and we’ll get our will o’
ither; be as haining of every thing as you can, for thou kens
it’s a’ thy ain; but the corpse’s sister and some other people
came in, and ben they came to see the corpse, lifts the cloth
off his face, and seeing him all in a pour of sweat, said, Hegh,
he’s a bonny corp,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and a lively like colour, when he could no
longer contain to carry on the joke, but up he got amongst
them, a deal of the people ran for it, and his wife cried out, O
my dear, do ye ken me? Ay ye base jade and whore, better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
than ever I did. Jumps on to the floor and gets his staff, and
runs after Sandy, and catches him in the fields a little from the
house, gives him a hearty beating, never tell’d him for what;
returns to the house, ate and drank with his sister and neighbours
who had come to see his corpse; poor Sandy went home
with a skinful of terror, and a sorting of sore bones, took a sore
fever, and died in a few days after, so he got quit of his cockler,
and Leper’s mother got her meal.</p>

<p>Leper’s mother was a careful industrious wife, but as the
by-word is ‘A working mother makes a daly daughter,’ and so it
happened here, for she had two idle glaket sluts of daughters,
that would do nothing but ly in their bed in the morning, till
(as the saying is) ‘The sun was like to burn a hole in their
backsides;’ the old woman being at this time busy bleaching
some cloth, was very early at work in the mornings, and
Leper’s patience was worn out with the laziness of his two
sisters, and he resolved to play a trick on them for their reformation;
so he goes and gets a mortcloth<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and spreads it
upon the bed above them, and sends the dead bell<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> thro’ the
town, inviting the people to his sisters’ burial the next day, at
four o’clock afternoon, for they had died suddenly; this
brought all the neighbour-wives in, who one after another
lifted the mortcloth, and said with a great sigh, ‘They’re gone
to their rest, a sudden call indeed!’ Their aunt hearing of
this sudden news, came running in all haste, and coming
through the green where the jades mother was at work, who was
ignorant of the story, she cries out, ‘Fy upon you, woman, fy
upon you,’ says she. What’s the matter, sister? What’s the
matter? ‘I think ye may let your work stand for ae day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
when your daughters are lying corpse.’ My bairns corpse! I
am certain they went to bed <ins class="corr" id="tn-117" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'heal and fiar'">
heal and fair</ins> last night. But I tell
you (says the other) the dead bell has been through the town,
warning the folk to the burial, then the mother cries out, ‘O
the villain, O the villain, that he did not send me word.’ So
they both ran, and the mother as soon as she entered the
house, flies into the bed, crying, ‘O my bairns, my dear bairns!’
on which the sluts rises up in a consternation, to the great
surprize of the beholders, and to the great diversion of the
whole town, and to the great mortification of girls, who thought
shame to set their noses out of doors.</p>

<p>Leper and his master went to a gentleman’s house to work,
where there was a saucy house-keeper, who had more ignorance
and pride, than good sense and manners; she domineered
over her fellow-servants in a tyrannical manner; Leper resolved
to mortify her pride; so he finds an ant’s nest, and
takes their white eggs, grinds them to a powder, and puts them
into the dish her supper-sowens was to be put in. After she
had taken her supper, as she was covering the table, the imock-powder
began to operate, and she let a great fart, well done
Margaret, says the laird, she runs away for shame, but before
she turned herself round, she gives another raird. My faith, says
the Laird, Margaret, your arse would take a cautioner; before
she got out of the chamber-door, she lets fly another crack;
then she goes to order her fellow-servant to give the laird his
supper, but before she could give the necessary directions, she
gave fire again, which set them all a laughing; she runs into
a room by herself, and there she played away her one gun
battery so fast, as she had been sieging the Havannah. The
laird and lady came to hear the fun, they were like to split
their sides at proud Maggy, so next morning she left the place,
to the great joy of her fellow servants.</p>

<p class="noindent">Leper’s Landlady became very harsh to his Master, and very
often abused him exceeding sore with both tongue and hands,
and always chided upon him for more money, and to have all the
money in her keeping, which Leper was very sorry for. It so
happened on a day, after the Taylor had got a hearty drubbing
with tongue and tongs, that he pouch’d his thimble, and was
going to make a Queen of her? when she saw that, she cried
out, ‘O will you leave me, a poor tender, dying woman?’ But
Leper knowing the cause of her cursed ill-nature better than
his Master did, advised him to take her on a fine day, like a
mile out of town, and give her a walk, and he would stay at
home, and study a remedy for her disorder.&mdash;&mdash;Away they
goes, but as she was always complaining of her health, and
that she was very weak, she cry’d out frequently, ‘O it is a
crying sin to take a woman in my condition out o’er a
door.’ During their absence, Leper goes and searches her bed,
and below the bolster he gets a bottle of rare whisky, of which
he takes a hearty pull, and then pisses in it to make it up
again, gets a halfpenny worth of snuff and puts it in also,
shakes all together, and so sets it in its place again. Home
they came again, and she was exceedingly distressed as a
woman could be, and cry’d out, ‘It was a horrid thing to take
her out of a house.’ The taylor seeing her so bad, thought she
would have died, and ran as fast as he could and brought her
a dram, but she in her hypocrisy pretended she could not take
it, and called him to help her to bed. Into her bed he lays
her, and he was not well gone until she fell to her bottle, taking
two or three hearty gluts, then she roars out murder, for she
was poisoned, she was poisoned. Bocking and purging began,
and the neighbours are called in, she leaves her blood on poor
Leper, and tells how such an honest woman brought her ae<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
bottle as another was done, and the murdering lown had stole
it, and put in a bottle of poison instead of it. Leper took
to his heels, but was pursued and carried before a Justice of the
Peace, where he told what he had done, which made the Justice
laugh heartily at the joke, and the Taylor’s wife was well purged
both from her feigned sickness, laziness, and cursed ill nature, for
always when she began to curl her nose for the future, the Taylor
had no more to say, ‘But, Maggy, Maggy, mind the bottle.’</p>

<p>Leper was working with a master taylor in Glasgow, who
hungered his men, and one morning just as the breakfast was set
on the table, in comes a gentleman to try on a suit of clothes, the
Master being obliged to rise, desired the lads to say the grace
themselves, every one refused it, and put it to his neighbour,
till Leper took it, and said as follows, with an audible voice,
that the stranger gentleman might overhear him; “Oh, hoch,
we are a parcel of poor beastly bodies, and we’re as beastly
guided, if we do not work we get nothing to eat, yet we are
always eating and always fretting, fidging and half fasting is
like to be our fortune, scartings and scrapings are the most of
our mouthfu’s; we would fain thank thee for thy fulness if
ever it were so, but the rest of our benefactors are not worth
the acknowledging, hech hey, Amen,” which made the gentleman
laugh till he held his sides, and gave Leper half a crown
to drink.</p>

<p>Leper was not long done with his apprenticeship till he set
up for himself, and got a journeyman and an apprentice, was
coming into very good business, and had he restrained his
roguish tricks might have done very well. He and his lads
being employed to work in a farmer’s house, where the goodwife
was a great miser, and not very cleanly in making ready
of meat, and snivel’d greatly when she spoke. In the morning
when she went to make their pottage, she made a fashion of
washing the pot, which to appearance seemed to him to be
among the first pots that had been made; then she set it
down before the fire till she went to the well, in which time
Leper looking into it, sees two great holes in the bottom
stopped with clouts, he takes up his goose, and holds it as high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
as his head, then lets it fall into the pot, which knocked out
the bottom of it; presently in comes the wife with the water,
and pours it into the pot, which set the fire-side all in a dam,
for still as she poured it in, it ran out, the wife being short-sighted,
or what they call sand-blind, looks into the pot,
holds up both her hands and cries, “The losh preserve me,
sirs, for the grip atween the twa holes is broken;” says
Leper the pot was old enough, but do you not ken that
taylor’s pottage is heavier than other mens: indeed lad,
said she, I believe it is sae, but they say ye’re a Warlock,
it’s Wednesday a’ the warld o’er,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and a woful Wednesday
to me indeed, my pot might have lasted me this fifty
years, a sae wad it een.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This sport diverted Leper and his
lads thro’ the day, and after supper, knowing he was to get
but some dirty bed, as the cows and the people lived all in one
apartment,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> he chused rather to go home; and knowing the
moon was to rise a little after midnight, they sat long by the
fire, told them many a fine story to drive away the time, and
bade the wife go and make their bed to see how it might be;
to save candle she made it in the dark, directly on the floor
behind where they sat, shaking down two bottles of straw: a
calf which chanced to be lying on that spot, and which the
wife did not notice, was covered up with the straw, and the bed
clothes spread over all. The most of the family being gone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
to bed, the wife told them several times to go to bed also; but
Leper knowing of the calf, said, I’ll make my bed come to me,
on which the wife began to pray for herself, and all that was
in the house; so up he gets his elwand, and gives a stroke on
the bed, which caused the brute to get up, and not seeing
where to go, it fell a crying, and turning round, which set the
whole cows in the whole house a roaring out murder in their
own tongue, the wife ran to the bed above the goodman, and
the whole family cried out, not knowing what it was, but
Leper and his two lads whipp’d off the blankets off the brute,
and it ran in among the rest unperceived, then Leper lighted
a candle, and all of them got out of bed, paid Leper for his
work, and more if he pleased, and begged him to go away, and
take the devil with him. So home he went, but never was
employed by that wife more.</p>

<p>Leper had a deal of the best customers, both in town and
country; so one time he had occasion to go to the parish of
Inchinan to make a wedding suit for a gentleman; after they
were finished, he asked drink-money to his lads, which the
gentleman refused: Leper resolved to be even with him, so
goes to the hay-loft where the groom slept, and takes his
stockings, breeches and jacket, sews them altogether, and stuffs
them full of hay, makes a head, puts a rope about the neck,
and hangs it on a tree opposite to the Laird’s window, then
goes to the Laird and tells him that his groom had hanged
himself, and that if he would open his window, he would see
him hanging; the laird struck with astonishment knew not
what to do; Leper advises him to bury him privately, the
Laird said, he had not a servant he could trust, so begged of
Leper to do it, Leper refuses, till the Laird promised him
a load of meal: then Leper pulls all the hay out of the
groom’s clothes, goes and gets his load of meal and sends it
to Glasgow, then goes to the groom, and says hastily, lad,
thy master is wanting thee; so the lad in a haste runs to see
what his master wanted, the Laird no sooner saw him opening
the door, than he cry’d out, Avoid thee Satan, avoid thee
Satan; the lad says, What’s the matter, Sir? What’s the mat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>ter?
Did not you hang yourself this morning? Lord forbid!
said the lad: the laird says, If thou be an earthly creature,
take that tankard and drink; which he did: Then says
he to his Master, Leper called me up and said, you wanted me
in all haste: Ho, ho, says the Laird, I find out the story now,
If I had Leper I would run my sword through him: But Leper
before that was away for Glasgow with his meal.</p>

<p>Leper was in use to give his lads their Sunday’s supper,
which obliged him to stay from the Kirk in the afternoon, he
having neither wife nor servant-maid; so on Sunday afternoon,
as he was at home cooking his pot, John Muckle-cheeks and
James Puff-and-Blaw, two Civileers, having more zeal than
knowledge, came upon him and said, What’s the matter Sir,
you go not to the kirk? Leper replied, I am reading my
book, and cooking my pot, which I think is the work of
necessity. Then says the one to the other, Don’t answer the
graceless fellow, we’ll make him appear before his betters, so
they took the kail-pot and puts a staff thro’ the bowls, and
bears it to the Clerk’s chamber.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Leper who was never at a
loss for invention, goes to the Principal of the College his
house, no body being at home but a lass roasting a leg of
mutton; Leper says, My dear, will you go and bring a pint of
ale, and I’ll turn the spit ’till you come back, the lass was no
sooner gone, than he runs away with the leg of mutton, which
served his lads and him for their supper. When the Principal
came home, he was neither to bin nor ha’d, he was so
angry; so on Monday he goes and makes complaint to the
Lord Provost, who sends two officers for Leper, who came
immediately. My Lord asked him, How he dared to take
away the Principal’s mutton? Leper replied. How came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
your Civileers to take away my kail-pot? I am sure, there is
less sin in making a pot-full of kail, than roasting a leg of
mutton, Law-makers should not be law-breakers, so I demand
justice on the Civileers; the Provost asked him, what justice
he would have? says he, Make them carry the pot back
again; as for the Principal, a leg of mutton won’t make him
and me fall out: so they were forced to carry the pot back,
and Leper caused the boys to huzza after them to their disgrace.</p>

<p>There was a Barber which always plagued Leper, calling
him a Prick-the-Louse; Leper resolved to be even with him, so
he goes and buys three sheep-heads, and sends for the Barber
and told him, that there were three Southland gentlemen come
to his house, who wanted to be shaved, and he assured him he
would receive sixpence for each one of them, this good news
made the shaver send for a dram; Leper was still praising
them for quiet good natured gentlemen, so Leper takes him
to the bed where the sheep-heads lay covered, and desired him
to waken them, for they would not be angry, or say an ill
word to him, the Barber lifts the covering and sees the sheep-heads,
runs out cursing and swearing, and Leper crying after
him, Sheep-head Barber.</p>

<p>The Barber resolved to be revenged on Leper, so when he
was shaving Mess John, he tells him that Leper was the
drunkenest fellow in the parish; so Mess John warns him to
the session, Leper comes and says, What do you want with
me, Sir? Come away Leper, says Mess John, I hear a bad
report of you; Me, Sir! I am sure they were not my friends
that told you that. Indeed, I am informed you are a great
drunkard; I a drunkard! you have not a soberer man in
your parish: Stay Sir, I’ll tell you how I lead my life: In the
morning I take a choppin of ale, and a bit of bread, that I
call my morning: for breakfast I generally take a herring and
a choppin of ale, for I cannot sup brose like my lads; the
herring makes me dry, so at eleven hours I take a pint; at
dinner another pint; at four afternoon my comrades and I
join, sometimes we are a pint and sometimes three choppins;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
at supper I take a bite of bread and cheese and a pint, and so
I go to bed: Mess John says, It’s extravagant Sir, it’s excessive
drinking, I allow you the one half of it for a quarter of a
year; says Leper, I’ll try it, Sir, and come back and tell you.
At the end of the quarter he draws out his account, and goes
to Mess John, who was sitting with his elders in the session-house,
and says, Sir, I have a demand on you: On me, Sir!
Yes, on you, Sir; Don’t you remember you allowed me so
much drink for a quarter of a year, and I want the money;
Am I to pay your reckoning, Sir? You allowed it, and if you
won’t pay it, I’ll take you before the Provost: The Elders advised
him to pay it or he would be affronted: so Leper got
the money: When he was at the door, he says, Sir, will ye
stand another quarter? Get away, says Mess John, and don’t
trouble me. Leper says, I’m sure you may, for I was always
two-pence to your penny.</p>

<p>[The edition here followed was published in the year 1816, without any mention
of the place of issue. It contains also the two parts of <em>Leper the Taylor</em>. The
full title is:&mdash;‘Fun upon Fun, or, the Comical Merry Tricks of Leper the Taylor.
In two Parts. To which are added, The Grand Solemnity of the Taylor’s
Funeral, who lay Nine Nights on his own Shop-Board, together with his Last
Will.’ It has been collated with an edition published in 1820, and with another,
apparently of English origin, without date. This chap-book, as has been explained
in the Introduction, Vol. I., p. 48, is believed to be the third part of
<cite>Leper the Taylor</cite>; and M‘Vean has given his sanction to the conjecture by entering
it in his list of <cite>Opera Dugaldi</cite>. Upon a close study of the work, however,
and after a careful comparison of it with the two parts of <cite>Leper the Taylor</cite>, the
editor cannot avoid the suspicion that what appears in the following pages is not
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fide</i> work of Dugald Graham. That suspicion is founded not only upon
the almost entire absence of Scotticisms, but also upon the mention of some customs
which were certainly not common in Scotland, such, for instance, as the
presentation of a sprig of rosemary to each person at a funeral, and the corpse
arrest. These were more prevalent in England. While that is so, the fact that
the work forms a quite consistent conclusion to the other two parts, and that
Dugald did not always run in the same groove, prevents the editor from pressing
this suspicion to an extreme; and he contents himself with marking the authorship
as doubtful.]</p></div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Leper<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> in his life-time desired, That all those who came to
attend his funeral, might be handsomely entertained with a
half-penny-roll, and a pint of ale;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> in memory of the many
breakfasts he had made in his life-time: And furthermore
desired, That those who were his former<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> relations and chief
mourners, instead of a mourning ring, might be presented with
a Taylor’s Thimble, in memory of his own trade, and round
the rim to have this motto engraved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Be sure you Feed Hell.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Round the room hung divers remnants of black-cloth, of the
Taylor’s own cabbaging, for he was very honest that way, and
never cabbaged but a quarter<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> out of a yard. At the four corners
of the room stood four woolen-drapers, lamenting the loss
of so good a customer, with each of them a white wand in his
hand, just a yard long and a parchment label hanging on their
shoulders, with this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The Taylor has finished his work,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>And now he is gone to receive his wages.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the head of the Taylor’s coffin, stood the goose triumphant,
the cabbage blazoned, and the cucumber argent. On
the lid of his coffin was engraven, on a brass plate, this applicable
motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Hell is beneath me.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>At the foot of the coffin was the sheers pendent, the bodkin
rampant, and the thimble enclosed in three ermins.</p>

<p>When the Corpse was conveyed down stairs, each person
was served decently round with a leaf of red cabbage, instead
of a sprig of rosemary. Then the Corpse was hoisted on the
shoulders of six piece-brokers, having each of them this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The Taylor steals, we buy.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pall was supported by those who sold stay-tape, buckram,
and canvas.</p>

<p>The Corpse was followed down Cloth-fair by thirty-six
master-taylors, each having a yard in his right-hand, with a
parchment streamer at the end of it, with this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>We Taylors by our art and trade</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Do often mend what God hath made.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next followed twenty-four<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> woolen-drapers, two-by-two,
bearing on their breasts this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>We deal in wool, but can’t forbear</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>To deal, alas! some times in hair.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then followed the like number of button-makers, wringing
their hands with this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Man’s but a Button, by my soul!</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The very Grave’s a Button-hole.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After these, followed a vast number of city ricketty hopper-arsed
beaux, who had been padded up, and made into a complete
gentlemen, by the deceased limb-trimmer, drying their
watery eyes, with cambrick hankerchiefs, and having this
motto engraved on their watch cases:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>He’s gone who made us human shapes,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>And now we must again turn apes.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But to conclude the procession: Last of all, followed a
numerous croud of journeymen taylors, who were all slip-shoed,
their stockings about their heels, their hats off, a skein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of thread hung carelessly about their necks; and their shirt
collars were open, that they might have liberty to disturb their
bosom friends. On their left sleeve was a cushion, whereon
stuck abundance of Spanish and Whitchapel needles. The
tails of their wigs were matted like horses’ manes, just as if
they had come off the shop-board from work. On their left
shoulders each had a long strip of parchment, whereon was
written this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The lice bite us, ’tis not deny’d, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em> }</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>We bite our masters when employ’d;</em> }</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>And they bite all the world beside. &nbsp; &nbsp;</em> }</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the bottom of Cloth-fair, the Corpse was arrested at the
suit of an old herb-woman for elevenpence halfpenny,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> which
had been due a long time to the hag, for cabbages and cucumbers,
which the deceased had in his life-time: However the
journeymen-taylors manfully released the Corpse,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and afterwards
marched on in ample procession to the house of one
Ned Kemp, an honest piece-broker, where there was a spacious
grave dug, between a large cabbage and a cucumber plant.</p>

<p>The FUNERAL SERMON was preached by Obadiah
Backstitch, and the words of the text were these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>A remnant of all shall be saved.</em><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After which, the journeymen taylors were admitted into
the house,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and each of them served with a halfpenny-roll, and
a pint of ale, and so went weeping home, for the loss of so
good a master.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is a certain old saying, That where women are conveen’d
in crouds there can be but little silence; and some have
acknowledged that it was a great bondage for them to hold
their peace in the church: and where there is much talk by
ignorant speakers, it is diverting for persons of understanding
to hear them. Therefore we have furnished the public with a
small collection of old wives noted sayings and wonders, which
they relate happened in their own time, also what has been
told them by their forefathers.</p>

<p>Two old wives (Maggy, and Janet) at their rocks, began
their cracks as follows:</p>

<p>Janet. A dear Maggy, an how auld will ye be now, o’ it’s
lang since I kend you.</p>

<p>Maggy. Indeed Janet that’s what nae body kens, for my
father and mither had sae mony o’ us, they ne’er counted how
auld ane o’ us was, they minded ay wha o’ us was born first,
and wha was neist ane anither, and that was a’ that e’er we
sought to ken about it; but I ha’e mind o’ the mirk Munonday.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Jan. Hout, tout, woman, the mirk Munonday, I hae mind
since there was nae Munondays at a’, and the Sabbath days
was nae com’d in fashion, there was a day they ca’d Sunday
came anes o’ the ouk for it, we kend ay whan it came, for my
father cow’d ay his beard whan the bell rang, and then every
body ran to the kirk it had ony thing ado, an it were to buy
saut or shune, for the chapman chiels set up a’ their creims at
the kirk-door, an the lasses wad a gotten keeking glasses, red
snudes, needles, prins, elshin irons, gemlets, brown bread and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
black saep to buy, forby sweety wives things, and rattless for
restless little anes; the men wad a bought pints o’ ale, an a
gotten a whang o’ gude cheese to chow a’ the time a drinking
o’t, hout, tout ay, they were braw markets on the Sundays i’
the time o’ Paepery,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> we had nae ministers than but priests,
Mess Johns, Black Friers, and White Friers, Monks, Abbots,
and Bishops, they had nae wives, yet the best o’ them wad a
spoken baudy language, and a kiss’d the lasses, fikle fyking
bodies they ware, unko ill to please, they wad a baith curs’d
fouk and bless’d them, just as ye pay’d them; a deed they
were unco greedy o’ the penny, and pray’d ay to the dead
fouk, and gard the living pay them for’t, and although they
had play’d the loon wi’ a poor hizey she durst na speak o’t for
her very life, for they cou’d gi’ ony body o’er to the de’il when
they liket: They did not gar fouks learn to read and pray
like our new ministers, but thump on your breast, strake your
fingers o’er aboon your nose, tell your beads and rin bare-fit
thro’ amang hard stanes, and cauld sna’.</p>

<p>Mag. A hech woman, an wad they a had carnal dealings
wi’ the women, and they sae good and haly.</p>

<p>Jan. Hout ye daft woman, do ye think their goodness
gelded them tho’ they had nae wives; there was a great sort
o’ them it they ca’d cardonels, that ay when twa young bodies
was married they bute to hae the first night o’ the bride.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Mag. A wae worth them filthy hureing dogs, if I wadna’ a
libbet them mysel, I wonder that the gentle fouks and lairds
lote them do the like o’ that.</p>

<p>Jan. A dear woman the gentle fouks and the lairds keepet
ay in wi’ them, for they said they had the command o’ the
de’il and the dead fouk, and the gentles durst na cast out wi’
them, for they got a’ their sins pardon’d for the less siller.</p>

<p>Mag. A dear woman that was unko like, the de’il wad get
nae body then but the poor fouk, and them that had nae siller.</p>

<p>Jan. A well a wat that was true, for an they pay’d the
priest well, the de’il durst na middle wi’ them.</p>

<p>Mag. A wow woman, a what’s come o’ them a’ now, am
sure the like o’ thae fouks it had sae meikle power, needed
neither die nor yet be sick: they wad live a’ their days.</p>

<p>Jan. A wat well did they, for the maist o’ them is dead
and rotten, and the rest o’ them gade awa’ to Italy, where the
auld Pape their father, the de’il, the witches, brownies and
faries dwal,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and then we gat anither sort o’ gospel fouks it
they ca’d curits,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> fine sort o’ dainty honest foulks they war,
but gay and greedy, they did na’ like sculdudery wark, but
said na meikle against it, for a hantle o’ bits a callans wad a
gotten twa or three bastards before they wad a gotten breeks;
they beit to hae their tithes of every thing that grew, mony a
time my father wist they wad take the tithes of his hemp too,
an it were to hang themsels, they were ay warst whare a poor
man or wife died, altho’ they left weans fatherless and mitherless,
a deed they wad a sent their bellman, and wi’ his lang
prelatic fingers he wad a harled the upper pair o’ blankets aff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
o’ the poor things bed, for some rent that they gard fouks pay
for dying, a sae did they e’en, and yet they keepit a hantle o’
bra haly days, and days o’ meikle meat, Fastrens-e’en and
Yule days, when we gat our wames fou o’ fat brose, and a sippet
Yule sowens till our sarks had been like to rive, and after
that a eaten roasted cheese and white puddings well spiced,
O bra times for the guts, well I wat every body might live
than that had ony thing to live on.</p>

<p>Mag. But dear Janet ye’er bra an lang o’ the memory, do
ye mind o’ the waefu blast, when the foul thief was raging in
the air, and the de’il dang doun a’ the kail yard dykes cutted
the corn stacks, tirr’d the houses and blew giddy Wille’s wig
in the wall, they said it was some young minister it had rais’d
the de’il, and for want o’ a cock, a cat, or some unkirsen’d
creature to gi’ him, they could na’ get laid again, an he brake
the bridle slipped his head an ran awa frae them.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Jan. A deed woman I heard tell o’ that, and how wood
Willie M‘Neel met him on the staps in the mids o’ the water,
an shot him o’er, and thought to drown him, but he gade doun
the water like a meikle branded bill roaring, a’ burning fire;
but I hae mind the first time it the de’il came to this kintrey
was on a Sunday, I was a wi’ bit gaun lassie my father and a’
the men fouk was at the kirk, the ware twa o’ them, a humeld
ane an a horn’d ane, a goodman de’il, and a goodwife de’il as
we took them to be, we ran a’ into the house, and my mither
barr’d the door and hunted the dogs at the byre hole, thinking
the de’il wou’d rin frae the dogs, but, na, na, they got up on
their tae end like twa auld men, they were a rugh lang hair
like a pyet horse, wi’ lang bairds aneath their chin, and the
meikle horn’d de’il box’d the dogs in at the hole agen, we ran
a’ ben the house and grat, but our Jock wha wis a little
gabby gaun laddock, cry’d ay, mither, mither, what is the
de’il seeking here, he’ll be wanting to tak a’ the auld wives an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
cats to mak witches o’ them,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> I true whan my gran mither
heard that, she gat up and ran ben to the spence, and crap in
the bear meal barrel to hide hersel frae the de’il, and curr’d
there ’till the kirk skaild, a deed she was sae fear’d, she made
her burn in the barrel; and what was’t true ye after a’ but a
tupe and a ewe of the highland gaits, it the laird had gotten to
gie the lady milk, but mony a day we leugh at the twa de’ils.</p>

<p>Mag. But dear woman, what an a body is that de’il, it
ev’ry body is sae fear’d for him, is’t na him they ca’ auld nick,
what fore do they ca’ him auld nick?</p>

<p>Jan. A dead woman I dinna ken what like a body he is,
but they say he’s a’ black, and they ca’ him auld nick, because
he’s aulder nor Adam, and Adam was the first man in the
warld, and they say the de’il will never die, nor yet be sick,
nor yet tak sair een.</p>

<p>Mag. A wow Janet but ye’re a witty creature, but can ye
tell me what way the blackamoors is made, some fouk says
they’re a’ dipped in cats blood and burnt bear strae, but I’m
ay thinking the litster doucks them in amang the broe that
they lit the black claith wi’, and then sells them to the lairds
and gentle folks to flee their bairns wi’, or dis the gentles eat
them when they’re dead think ye.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Jan. Hout awa daft creature, the blackamoors is fouk just
like oursel, but only they hae a black skin on them, did ye
never see black sheep and white sheep, black horse and white
horse, ye think they’re a’ de’ils because the de’il’s black: I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
thought mysel lang syne, they were made for the penny, and
sell’d the dearer o’ the black skin.</p>

<p>Mag. But Janet did ye ever see the de’il, I wad fain ken
what like he is, some says he’s like a bill, a bear or an auld beggar
man.</p>

<p>Jan. Indeed I never saw sae muckle as the de’il a’ my
days, but I’ve heard the ministers flyting and misca’ing him,
and whan they said a’ that they cou’d say o’ him, they ca’d
him an ill spirit, and a great liar, mony a ane has war names
than a’ that yet.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Mag. But do you think there is ony de’ils but ane, every
body’s speaking an crying on him, ane couldna answer them a’.</p>

<p>Jan. A deed they say there’s black anes and white anes o’
them, humel anes, and horn’d anes, the very witches is haf
de’ils whan they’re living, and hail de’ils when they’re dead;
the brownies is haf dogs haf de’ils, a’ rugh but the mouth, seeks
na claise, ae man’s meat ’ill sair them, and they’ll work ten
mens work in ae night, forby hob-goblins fairies and elfs, that
shoots fouks beasts to dead, an no a hole to be seen in the
skin o’ them;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> hard na ye tell o’ the twa Highland wives, how
the tane cry’d oh, on, oh on, Shenet my cows shot, houp, poup,
co’ she, an wha shot her, a de’d it was the de’il, oh hough, oh
hough, Shenet we’ll a’ be kill’d whan the de’il has gotten a gun.</p>

<p>Mag. A sweet be wi’ us woman, is nit an unco thing they
dinna a’ flee on the minister, whan he flytes and misca’s them
sae, do ye think they hear him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Jan. A doubtless but they hear and sees too, they’re
neither blind nor bleer-ey’d, but ay whan ye speak o’ them,
name the day cry it’s wansday thro’ a’ the warld and there’s
nae fear o’ you.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Mag. But what de ye think o’ our minister, is he a good
man think ye?</p>

<p>Jan. Indeed I think he’s a gay gabby body, but he has twa
fauts, and his wife has three, he’s unko greedy o’ siller, and he’s
ay preaching down pride, and up charity, and yet he’s that fou
o’ pride himsel, that he has gotten a glass window on ev’ry
side o’ his nose, and his een is as clear as twa clocks to luk
to, he has twa gigglet gilliegaukies o’ dochters, comes into the
kirk wi’ their cobletehow mutches frizel’d up as braid’s their
hips, and clear things like starns about their necks, and at ev’ry
lug a walloping white thing hanging like a snotter at a bubbly
wean’s nose, syne about their necks, a bit thin claith like a
mouse web and their twa bits o’ paps playing ay niddity nod,
shining through it like twa yearning bags, shame fa’ them and
their fligmagaries baith, for I get nae good o’ the preaching
looking at them; and syne a’ the dirty sherney hought hizies
in the parish maun hae the like or lang gae; but an I ware to
preach, sic pride sudna hae baith peace and property in my
parish, I wou’d point out my very finger to them in the kirk,
and name them baith name and sirname, and say there sits
sherney Meg o’ the mill, stumpy May o’ the moss, sniveling
Kate wi’ her hodle-makenster coat, they came into the kirk
bobbing their hin quarters like three water wag tails, shaking
their heads like a hunder pund horse, smacking their lips and
hauding their mouth like May puddocks; and what shall I
compare them to, but painted Jezebels; the whore of Babylon
or Rachel the harlot, with a’ their gaudy decoying colours,
high taps, and spread glittering tails, whan they come sailing
into the house of prayer, as it were a house o’ dancing and
debaushery, go, go, ye painted pisweips to fairs and weddings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
and there display your proud banners of pride which ye are
puffed up with, it is the very spirit o’ the devil, and unbecoming
o’ the house o’ prayer: But if these gillygaukies shou’d come
into the kirk with their heels up and their heads down, our
mess John is become like ane o’ the dogs of Egypt, he’ll no
move his tongue, and I believe he darna for Clipock his wife;
wha’s element is to banter a’ the poor beggars from her door,
nane can stand her but the tinkler wives, and she’s ay whinging
about charity, but it’s to hersel, she widna pity the cripple
on the blind’s back, but bids gae hame to their ain parish
filthy beggar dirt,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> she casts a’ her cauld paritch and kail to
the cocks and hens, kicks the poor colly dogs out at the door,
ca’s them filthy useless brutes, because they canna lay eggs,
like hens eggs, she’s ay flyting on her lasses, hungers her
servant lad, eats cocks and hens hersel, and gars the poor
minister eat saut herrin.</p>

<p>Mag. A well I wat then I wish he may not turn a drucken
body, for herring maks fouk ay dry, but well I wat Janet ye
hae tell’d their faults on baith the sides, an I hae ae great faut
to our minister yet, and tho’ I ware dead and rotten the night
afore the morn I’ll neither forgi’ him nor yet forget him, a
what he said to me, that I sud be ta’en and douked for offerin
to marry agen, a woman at my age; an auld man, said he,
ought to marry some kindly body to keep him clean in his
auld age, but an auld woman (said he) that can wash a dud
sark to themsels needs nae men; and now no Janet, I am no
to ca’ very auld although I be stricken in years, I dinna ken
my ain age, being kirsen’d in the time o’ Paepery;<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> I hae the
penny, tho’ bair o’ flesh and blood, has four good teeth before
and well willin gums in the backside, I canna gang far without
a staff, an yet I wad as fain be married as whan I was fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
year auld, O woman! but a man in the bed is an usefu body,
they hae a sweet breath, and natural heat to keep a body
warm; but an our minister ware an auld wife, he wad ken
what the want of a bit man is as well as I, and a’ this began
about wanton Wat the town taylor that promis’d to tak me
again sic a time or tell me what for, mony a pickle well butter’d
kail bleds I gi’d him, held out frae my ain wame and
stappit in a his, he said he wad do as muckle to me again, but
he has na don’t fause loun carle it he was, cheated me out o’
sax pund and twa sarks and then gar’d me mak a fool o’ mysel
whan the laird’s duket<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> was biggit and made a’ white to gar
the dows come, he said an my window ware as white they wad
come to me too, and I like a poor fool took a basin fu’ o’ good
bear meal and made it drammock and whitened a my window
wi’t, but the never a dow came near hand me the mair o’t, but
a’ the town dogs came pyking and licking it at night and day,
I was plagued wi’ them till a gude shure came and wisht awa
agen, the laird an every body came to look and laugh at it.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Jan. But Maggy an ye be a mind to marry ye maun snod
yoursel better up, cast awa your staff, singe your whiskers wi’ a
candle or fir stick, stand straight up like a rash kekle, and
looky cantylike whan the carles is gaun by, tak a mouthfu’ o’
good meat, and a drap dram in the mornin will keep the dirt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
aff your face and raise the red in your cheek, ye see the hens
turns ay red lugget or they begin to lay: a body that wants a
bit man will use mony a shift for ane, I ken how I did mysel
whan I was fourteen lang year a widow, and thought never
to gotten ane, I feed our John, whan he was a saft silly docus
callan to ca’ the pleugh, and keepit him three years till he
turn’d a wally whincer and fain wad I had him, but he widna
speak o’t to me, but ae day we was in the house our lane, an
I ties a gude hard stane knot on the strings o’ my toy beneath
my chin, an fykes wi’t awee, then says, O Johnny my man
look an ye can louse this knot wi’ your teeth, he lays a hand on
every shouther and louses the knot, and I gripes him by the
twa lugs and gies him a kiss, and saes poor man Johnny thou
has a sweet breath, thou needsna want a bit kiss o’ me whan
thou likes lad, I true that culli’d him hither ay the mair, ha,
ha, thou has nae art woman.</p>

<p>Enters Humphray Clinker, hearing a’ that past, perswades
his aunt Maggy that no man would marry such as her, for she
looked like a picture of death riding upon hunger’s back, a
rickle of banes row’d up in a runkly skin, had wasted her body
with water lythocks into a scrufe of skin and bane for want of
teeth to chow bread for the nourishment of her body, and that
he was com’d on purpose to write her testament or latter will,
that it was a lightness in her brain before death; therefore
she ought to go to bed and die directly,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> which she accordingly
did<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> by taking thought of what was said to her, the priest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
being sent for came and discoursed with her, but still she
keeping her purse in her hand, which he observed, desired
she would give it to her friends or she died, to which she
would answer by her sooth that she wad not, for she wad
tak it wi’ her, for she had heard every body say they were the
better o’ the penny wi’ them, gang whare they like, and so
died supposed to be an hundred and six years old.</p>

<p>Humphray’s aunt Janet is yet alive an has made an oration
in praise of the old women, and on the pride of the young.</p>

<p class="noindent">The madness of this unmuzzled age has driven me to mountains
of thoughts, and a continual meditation: It is enough to
make an auld wife rin red-wood, and drive a body beyond
the halter’s-end of ill-nature, to see what I see, and here what
I hear: Therefore the hinges of my anger are broke, and the
bands of my good and mild nature are burst in two, the door
of civility is laid quite open, plain speech and mild admonition
is of none effect; nothing must be used now but thunder-bolts
of reproach tartly trimm’d up in a tantalizing stile, roughly
redd up and manufactured thro’ an auld Matron’s mouth, who
is indeed but frail in the teeth, but will squeeze surprizingly
with her auld gums, until her very chaft-blades crack in the
crushing of your vice.</p>

<p>I shall branch out my discourse into four heads.</p>

<p>First, What I have seen, and been witness to.</p>

<p>Secondly, What I now see, and am witness to.</p>

<p>Thirdly, What I have heard, does hear, and cannot help; I
mean the difference between the old women and the young.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Conclude with an advice to young men and young
women, how to avoid the buying of Janet Juniper’s stinking
butter,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> which will have a rotten rift on their stomach as
long as they live.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>First, The first thing then, I see and observe is, that a
wheen daft giddy-headed, cock-nosed, juniper nebbed mothers,
bring up a wheen sky-racket dancing daughters, a’ bred up to be
ladies, without so much as the breadth of their lufe of land, it’s
an admiration to me, whare the lairds are a’ to come frae that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
to be coupled to them; work, na, na, my bairn manna work,
she’s to be a lady, they ca’ her Miss, I maun hae her lugs
bor’d says auld Numps the mither; thus the poor pet is
brought up like a mitherless lamb, or a parrot in a cage; they
learn naething but prick and sew, and fling their feet when the
fidle plays, so they become a parcel of yellow-faced female-taylors,
unequal matches for countrymen, Flanders-babbies,
brought up in a box, and must be carried in a basket; knows
nothing but pinching-poverty, hunger and pride; can neither
milk kye, muck a byre, card, spin, nor yet keep a cow from a
corn-rigg; the most of such are as blind penny-worths, as
buying pigs in pocks, and ought only to be matched with
Tacket-makers, Tree-trimmers, and Male-taylors, that they
may be male and female agreeable in trade, since their piper
fac’d fingers are not for hard labour; yet they might also pass
on a pinch for a black Sutor’s wife, for the stitching of white
seams round the mouth of a lady’s shoe; or, with Barbers or
Bakers they might be buckled, because of their muslin-mouth
and pinch-beck speeches, when barm is scant, they can blow
up their bread with fair wind, and when the razor is rough,
can trim their chafts with a fair tale, oil their peruke with their
white lips, and powder the beau’s pow with a French-puff;
they are well versed in all the science of flattery, musical tunes,
horn-pipes, and country-dances, though perfect in none but
the reel of Gamon.</p>

<p>Yet these are they the fickle farmer fixes his fancy upon; a
bundle of clouts, a skeleton of bones, Maggy and the Much,
like twa fir-sticks and a pickle tow, neither for his plate nor
his plow; very unproper plenishing, neither for his profit nor
her pleasure, to plout her hands through Hawkey’s<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> caff-cog,
is a hateful hardship for Mammy’s Pet, and will hack a’ her
hands. All this I have seen and heard, and been witness to;
but my pen being a goose-quill, cannot expose their names
nor places of abode, but warns the working-men out of their
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, I see another sort, who can work, and maun work
till they be married, and become mistresses themselves; but
as the young man receives them, the thrift leaves them; before
that, they wrought as for a wager, they span as for a premium,
busked as for a brag, scour’d their din skins as a wauker does
worsted blankets, kept as mim in the mouth as a minister’s
wife, comely as Diana, chaste as Susanna, yet the whole of
their toil is the trimming of their rigging, though their hulls
be everlastingly in a leaking condition; their backs and their
bellies are box’d about with the fins of a big fish,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> six petticoats,
a gown and apron, besides a side sark down to the
ankle-banes; ah! what monstrous rags are here, what a cloth
is consumed for a covering to one pair of buttocks! I leave
it to the judgement of any ten taylors in town, if 30 pairs of
mens’ breeches may not be cut, from a little above the easing
of Bessy’s bum, and this makes her a motherly-like woman, as
sturdy a fabric as ever strade to market or mill.</p>

<p>But when she’s married she turns a madam, her mistress did
not work much, and why should she! Her mother tell’d ay
she wad be a lady, but cou’d never show where her lands lay;
but when money is all spent, credit broken, and conduct out
of keeping, a wheen babling bubly bairns, crying piece minny,
parich minny, the witless waster<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> is at her wit’s-end. Work
now or want, and do not say that the world has war’d you;
but Lofty-Nodle, your giddy-headed-mother has led you
astray, by learning you to be a lady, before ye was fit to be a
servant-lass, by teaching you laziness instead of hard labour,
by giving you such a high conceit of yourself, that no body
thinks any thing of you now, and you may judge yourself to
be one of those, that wise people call Littleworth; but after
all, my Dear Dirty-face, when you begin the warld again, be
perfectly rich before you be gentle, work hard for what you
gain, and you’ll ken better how to guide it, for pride is an unperfect
fortune, and a ludicrous life will not last long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Another sort I see, who has got more silver than sense, more
gold than good nature, more muslins and means than good
manners, tho’ a sack can hold their siller, six houses and a half
cannot contain their ambitious desires. Fortunatus’s wonderful
purse<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> would fail in fetching the fourth part of their
worldly wants, and the children imitate their mothers, chattering
like hungry cranes, crying still I want, I want, ever craving,
willfully wanting, till all be brought to a doleful dish of
desolation, and with cleanness of teeth, a full breast, an empty
belly, big pockets without pence, pinching penury perfect
poverty, drouth, hunger, want of money, and friends both, old
age, dim eyes, feeble joints, without shoes or clothes, the real
fruits of a bad marriage, which brings thoughtless Fops to
both faith and repentance in one day.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Another thing I see, hear, and cannot help, is the
breeding of bairns, and bringing them up like bill-stirks, they
gie them walth o’ meat, but nae manners: but whan I was a
bairn, if I didna bend to obedience, I ken mysel what I gat
which learned me what to gie mine again; if they had tell’d
me tuts, or prute-no, I laid them o’er my knee, and a com’d
crack for crack o’er their hurdies, like a knock bleaching a
harn-web, till the red wats stood on their hips, this brought
obedience into my house, and banished dods and ill-nature out
at the door; I dang the de’il out o’ them, and dadded them
like a wet dish-clout till they did my bidding: But now the
bairns are brought up to spit fire in their mither’s face, and cast
dirt at their auld daddies: How can they be good who never
saw a sample of it; or reverence old age, who practised no
precepts in their youth? How can they love their parents,
who gave them black poison instead of good principles? Who
shewed them no good, nor taught them no duties! No marvel
such children despise old age, and reverence their parents as
an old horse does his father.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The last prevailing evil which I see, all men may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
hear, but none strive to help,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the banishment of that noble
holy-day called the Sabbath, which has been blasted by a
whirl-wind from the south; I am yet alive who saw this
hurricane coming thro’ the walled city<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> near Solway in the
South; it being on a Sunday, and a beautiful sun-shine day
amangst some foul weeks in harvest-weather, which caused the
Lord Mayor of the place to work hard, and put in the whole
fields of wheat harvest, and the priests of that church commended
him therefore: Because the season was backward,
why should not man be disobedient! And this infection is
come here also, surely the loss of this Sabbath-day will be
counted a black Saturday to some; when I walk in the fields,
I know it not but by the stopping of the plow, when in the
city, only by the clossness of a few shop-doors and the sound
of the bells; degenerate ideas of religion indeed! when the
high praise is sounded only by bell-metal, <em>A sounding Brass
and a tinkling Cymbal</em>: Is it not come to pass, the taverns
roar like Ætna’s mouth; children follow their gaming, and old
sinners their stroling about, nothing stopt but coal-carts and
common carriers, the Sabbath lasts no longer than the sermon,
and the sermon is measured by a little sand in a glass; many,
too many frequent the church, seemingly only to show their
antic dress, with heads of a monstruous form, more surprizing
than those described by Aristotle, as for length exceeding that
of an asses’s head, ears and all; and ah! How humbling would
it be, to see their heads struck into such a hideous form, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They disdain now to ride on pads as of old, or to be hobled
on a horse’s hurdies, but must be hurled behind the tail, safely
seated in a leather conveniency, and there they fly swiftly as in
the chariot of Aminadab.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>They will not speak the mother language<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> of their native
country, but must have southern oaths, refined like raw-sugar
thro’ the mills of cursing, finely polished, and fairly struck in
the profane mint of London, into a perfect form of flunky-language;
even the very wild Arabs from the mountain-tops,
who have not yet got English to profane his Maker’s name,
will cry, <em>Cot, Cot</em>; hateful it is to hear them swear, who cannot
speak. O! strange alteration since the days of old!<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the
downful of Popery, and the Prelates’ decay, when reformation
was alive, and religion in taste and fashion; the people during
the sabbath, were all packed up in closets, and their children
kept within doors, when every city appeared like a sanctuary,
nothing to be heard on the streets, but the sound of prayer on
the right-hand, and the melodious sound of psalms on the left.</p>

<p>Now is the days of counting, scribing, riding of horses, and
the sound of the post-horn come; surely there will be trade
now; and none will miss prosperity when every day is a fair;
I add no more on this head, but every one claim a right to his
own set time, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another grievance of the female offenders I cannot omit,
which attacks a man’s fancy, and is the cause of his fall;<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> I
mean Flighters who has gotten a little of the means of Mammon,
more silver than sense, more gold than good nature,
haughtiness for humility, value themselves as a treasure incomprehensible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
their heads and hearts of Ophir-gold, their
hips of silver, &amp; their whole body as set about with precious
stones, great and many are the congresses of their courtship,
and the solemnizing of their marriage is like the conclusion of
a peace after a bloody and tedious war.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>And what is she after all! yea, her poor penny will never
be exhausted, it must be laid out in lunacy and laziness, she
must have fine teas and the tuther thing: When pregnancy
and the speuing of porich approaches, then she prophecies of
her death; as she hatches life, she embraces laziness; then O
the bed, the bed, nothing like the bed for a bad wife, her body
becomes as par-boil’d,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> being so bed-ridden, this rots their
children in the brewing, and buries them in the bringing up;
yea, some mothers are so beastly, as to water the bed and
blame the child therefore; yet such lazy wives live long, and
their children soon die; their far fetched feigned sickness,
soon render the husband to the substance of one sixpence, he
becomes poor and hen-peck’t under such petticoat government.</p>

<p>But when I Janet was a Janet, and had the judgement of
my own house, my husband was thrice happy, I never held him
down, he was above me day and night, I sat late and raise
early, kept a fu’ house and rough back, when summer came we
minded winter’s cauld, we had peace ay at porich-time, and
harmony through the day; we supp’d our sowens at supper-time
with a seasonable heat, and went to bed good bairns
kent naething but stark love and kindness, we wrought for
riches, and our ages and earthly stores increased alike, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
hated pride and loved peace, he died with a good name; I let
you ken I live, but not as many do, not so lordly of my brain
as some are of their belly! and was not my life strange by
that now practised? Come help yourselves you hillocat-livers
and avoid it.</p>

<p>Now after a’, if a poor man want a perfect wife, let him
wale a weel blooded hissie wi’ braid shouders an thick about
the haunches, that has been lang servant in ae house, tho’
twice or thrice awa’ and ay fied back, that’s weel liked by the
bairns and the bairns’ mither, that’s naeway cankard to the
cats, nor kicks the colly-dogs amang her feet, that wad let a’
brute-beasts live, but rats, mice, lice, flaes, neets and bugs, that
bites the wee bairns in their cradles, that carefully comb the
young things’ heads, washes their faces, and claps their cheeks,
snites the snotter frae their nose<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> as they were a’ her ain, that’s
the lass that will mak a good wife; for them that dauts the
young bairns, will ay be kind to auld fouk an they had them.</p>

<p>And ony hale-hearted halsome hissie, that wants to halter
a good husband, never tak a widow’s ae son, for a’ the wifely
gates in the warld will be in him, for want of a father to teach
him manly actions; neither tak a sour looking sumf wi’ a
muckle mouth, and a wide guts, who will eat like a horse and
soss like a sow, suffer none to sup but himsel, eat your meat
and the bairns baith; when hungry angry, when fu’ full of
pride, ten sacks will not haud his sauce, tho’ a pea-shap wad
haud his siller: But go, tak your chance, and if cheated, channer
not on me, for fashionable fouk flee to fashionable things,
for lust is brutish-blind, and fond love is blear-ey’d. I add no
more, says Janet; so be it, said Humphray the Clerk.</p>

<p class="noindent">A certain old reverend priest, being one night at supper in
a gentleman’s house; and for one article having eggs, the
server of the table, as usual laid a cloath on every ones knee,
wherewith to hold their egg in when hot, when supper was
over, the priest looking down between his legs, and seeing the
white cloath thought it was his shirt-tail: and very slyly
stops it into his breeches bite, and bite, which the lady and
her maid observed, but was ashamed to challenge him; so
home he went with the servet in his breeches, and knew
nothing of it till going to bed, when it fell from him, his wife
enquired how he came by it, he could not tell, but was surprized
how he came to have more bulk in his breeches than
formerly, but perceiving the name they sent it back again, the
priest pleaded to be excused own’d himself only a thief
through ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>An old gentleman and his two sons, being in a company,
his oldest son sitting next him, spoke a word which highly
displeased his father; for which his father gave him a hearty
blow on the side of the head: A well said he, I will not lift
my hand to strick at my parents, but gives his other brother
that sat by him, a blow on the ear, saying give that about by
the way of a drink, till it comes to my father again.</p>

<p>A sailor being traveling between <em>Edinburgh</em> and <em>Linlithgow</em>
which is twelve long computed miles: and as he was setting
out in the morning about 8 o’clock, he seed a vain like young
spark go running past him, which he never minded, <ins class="corr" id="tn-157" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'but kep-jogging'">
but kept jogging</ins> on at his own leisure: and as he was going into <em>Linlithgow</em>,
about twelve o’Clock, up comes the young spark, and
asked the sailor, what a Clock it was, why says the sailor, I see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
you have a watch and I have none, what is it? out he pulls
his watch, ho said he, it’s directly twelve, and what do you
think, it was half an hour after ten or I came out of <em>Edinburgh</em>,
I have walked it in an hour and a half; it is pretty well tript,
says the sailor, but pray sir, what man of business are you?
O! said he, I am a watch maker, I was thinking so, said the
sailor, for you have made your watch to answer your feet, for
those feet can’t answer a right watch, and I suppose your
tongue can’t keep time with none of them do you remember
where you went past me this morning about eight o’Clock; O
yes said he, and off he went.</p>

<p>As two maids was coming from the milking of their cows,
one of them steping over a style, fell and spill’d the whole
peal full of milk from her head O said she, what will I do, what
will I do, O said the other maid, let it go who can help it now,
you can make it up again it is not your maiden-head: My
maiden-head said she, if it were my maiden-head, I would
think nothing of it, many, many a time, I have lost my maiden-head
with great pleasure, and I got it ay again, it came ay
back to its ain place again, but I’ll never gather up my milk
again.</p>

<p>A sailor being one night in company with a country taylor,
O said the taylor, but your trade is a very dangerous trade,
do you ever pray any? yes said the sailor, when we’re hard

wont be nimble and quick, a wow man but that’s a sad trade,
said the taylor, and what trade was your father? why said the
sailor, he was a sailor too, and where did he die, said the taylor?
why he was drowned at sea, and O man! said the taylor are
you not fear’d to go to sea? not I said the sailor: But what
trade was your father? indeed said the taylor, he was a taylor
as well as me, and where did he die? said the sailor, indeed he
died in his bed, says the poor taylor. O then says the sailor,
are not you afraid to go to bed lest you die there too.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Three merry companions having met on a saturdays night
at an Ale house, (a hatter and a shoemaker, and a taylor,)
where they drunk heartily all that night, and to morrow until
mid day; and their beats was who had the lovingest wife: So
they agreed for a trial of their good nature that every man
should do, whatever his wife bade him do; as soon as ever he
went home, or who did not as she ordered him, was to pay
all the reckoning, which was seven and six-pence, or if all of
them did as their wives bade them: then they were to pay
all alike: so on this agreement they all came away, first to
the hatters house, and in he goes like a madman, dancing and
jumping round the floor, his wife at the very time was taking
of the pot and setting it in the floor, he still dancing about,
now says the wife, ding over the pot with thy madness, so he
gives it a kick, and over it went, and that saved him as he had
done what his wife bad him do. Then away he goes to the
taylors house, and in he goes dancing likewise, but his wife
fell a scolding him. O says he, my dear give me a kiss? kiss
my arse you drunken rogue, said she; then to her he flys and
whips her over in the bed, up with her petty coats and kisses
her arse before them all, and that saved him; then away they
went to the shoe-makers, and in he goes very merry and dancing
about as he saw the other two do: saying come my dear
heart and give me a kiss: go hang yourself you drunken dog
said she, so he must either go and hang himself directly or pay
all the reckoning.</p>

<p>An honest highlandman not long since, not much acquainted
with the law, fell out with one of his neighbours, and to the
law they went; he employed one advocate, and his opposite
another, and as they were debeating it in court before the
judges, the highlandman being there present, a friend of his
asked him how he thought it would go, or who would win the
day, indeed said the highland man, his law man speaks well,

<p>A young woman by the old accident having got herself
with child, was called to the Session for so doing: and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
one elder another examining her how she got it, and where
she got it, and what tempt her to get it; and no doubt the
de’il wad get her for the getting of it; last of all the minister
he fell a enquiring how she got it, which run the poor lass out
of all patience about the getting of it, says the priest: tell me
plainly where it was gotten, I tell you said she, that it was
gotten in the byre, at a cows staike, and what other place do
you want to ken about: but said he, he did not tye you to the
cows staike, no said she, I did not need any tying, and how
far was between the byre and the house? just butt and ben, up
and down twa steps of a stone stair, then says the priest, why
did you not cry to the folks in the house: indeed sir, said she,
I could not get cried for laughing at it.</p>

<p>An old sodger being on a furlough from the north of Scotland,
having got no breakfast, fell very hungry by the way and
no ale house being near; came into a farmers house, and
desired they would sell, him some bread, or any kind of victuals:
to which the surly good wife reply’d, she never sold any
bread, and she was not going to begin with him, he had but
three miles and a bittok<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> to an ale-house, and he might march
on, and she did fair enough when she gide bits of bread for
naething to beggars though she gide nane to idle sodgers; he
had naething to do there awa: Hute said the goodman gi’
him a laidle fu’ o’ our kail, he’s been ay somebodys bairn, before
he was a sodger,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> What said she there not a drop in the
pot, they’re a’ in the plate before you, then gi’ him a spoon and
let him sup wi’ us, the soldier gets a spoon and thinking he
could sup all he seed himself, the first soup he put in his
mouth, spouted it back again in the plate, and crys out O my
sore mouth, the hide’s all of it yet since I had the Clap then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
every one threw down his spoon, the soldier got all to sup
himself, the wife stood cursing and scolding all the while, and
when he was done burnt both plate and spoon in the fire to
prevent the Clap: So the soldier came off with a full belly,
leaving the wife dressing the goodmans rigging with a four
footed stool, for bidding him sup.</p>

<p>A great drover who frequainted a public inn in the north of
England as he passed and repassed agreed with the servant
maid of the house, for a touch of love: for which he gave her
a six and thirty shilling piece: But on the next morning
mounted his horse without asking a bill, or what was to pay,
but sir, said the landlord, you forgot to pay your reckoning
well minded, sir said he, I want my change I gave your maid
a six and thirty to change, the poor maid is called on in haste,
yes said she I got it, but it was not for that, throws it down
and off she goes, her mistress understood and gave her the
challenge, she told her it was so, but she should be up with
him; so in twelve months thereafter, he came past with his
drove, puts up at the same inn as foremerly; then the
girl goes to a neighbour woman, and borrows a young child
about three months old, comes into the company where he
was, lays it down on the table, saying, sir there’s the change of
your six and thirty, and away she comes; the child crys, and
the bells rung, the landlord was ready enough to answer, O
sir, said he, call her back for this will ruin my family and crack
my credit, but sir said the girl, you thought nothing to ruin
my character and crack my maiden head; peace, peace said
he, my dear, here’s one hundred and fifty pound and take away
the child and trouble me no more, well said she I’ll take it:
But you will make more of buying cows than maiden heads;
so away she came with the money, and returned the borrowed
child to its own mother.</p>

<p>A churlish husband and virtuous wife one time fell sadly
out, because the wife had given something to the poor, what,
said he, mistress, I’ll let you know <ins class="corr" id="tn-161" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'ther  is nothing'">
there is nothing</ins> about this
house but what is mine and you’re mine, and your very arse is
mine; a well well goodman, then you will let me have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
take it all and give me peace: So away they went to bed the
goodwife turned her backside towards the goodman, and as he
was falling asleep, she draws up her smoke, and let’s fly in the
goodman’s shirt-tail, which wakened him in a great fright, as
he had been shot; ay, ay, woman, what are ye about; what
am I about, said she, dear woman your filling the bed, not I
goodman, for when my arse was my own I took care of it, and
take you care of it now it is yours. O rise woman and clean
the bed, and keep your arse, and a’ the liberty ye had before,
and more if you want it, fich fich, what’s this! am a dirt.</p>

<p>A ships crew being one time in great distress at sea by
reason of a violent storm, and being all fallen down to prayer,
expecting every moment to go to the bottom; there happened
to be an old gentleman a passenger on board with them who
had a great big red nose with drinking ale and whisky; and
being all at their last prayer as they thought, a little boy burst
out into loud laughter: O thou thoughtless rogue said the
captain what makes thee to laugh in seeing us all on the point
of perishing, why, said the boy, I cannot but laugh, to think
what a fine sport it will be when we are all drowning, to see
how that man’s red nose will make the water bizz when it
comes about it, at which words they all fell a laughing, and
cheered the crew, so that they made another attempt to weather
it out, and got all safe on shore at last.</p>

<p class="noindent">John Falkirk, commonly called the <em>Scots Piper</em>, was a
curious little witty fellow, with a round face and a broad nose.
None of his companions could answer the many witty questions
he proposed to them, therefore he became the wonder of the
age in which he lived. Being born of mean parents he got no
education, therefore his witty invention was truly natural; and
being bred to no business, he was under the necessity of using
his genius in the composition of several small books, of which
the following Cariches was one, which he disposed of for his
support. He became author of many small Tracts, and the
following curious and diverting pieces are said to be his composition,
viz.:&mdash;The History of John Cheap the Chapman, The
History of the Haveral Wives, Janet Clinker’s Oration, John
Falkirk’s Witty Jokes, Jockie and Maggie’s Courtship, The
Proverbs of the Pride of Women, History of Lothian Tom,
with many others, which are well known in Scotland, England,
and Ireland. In a word, he was</p>

<p>A. When she is that wicked as to tear the hair out of her
own head, when she cannot get at her neighbours, and thro’
perfect spite bites her own tongue with her own teeth, my
hearty wish is, that all such wicked vipers may ever do so.</p>

<p>Q. What is the effectual cure and infallible remedy for a
scolding wife?</p>

<p>A. The only cure is to get out of the hearing of her, but
the infallible remedy is to nail her tongue to a growing tree,
in the beginning of a cold winter night, and so let her stand
till sun-rising next morning, she’ll become one of the peacegblest
women that ever lay by a man’s side.</p>

<p>Q. What is the hardest dinner that ever a taylor laid his

<p>Q. What sort of commodities were sold there?</p>

<p>A. Nothing but ale and ill wicked wives.</p>

<p>Q. How was it abolished?</p>

<p>A. Because those who went to it once would go to it no
more.</p>

<p>Q. For what reason?</p>

<p>A. Because there was no money to be got for them, but
fair barter, wife for wife, and he who put away a wife for one
fault got a wife with two as bad.</p>

<p>Q. What was the reason that in those days, a man could
put away his wife for pissing the bed, and not for sh&mdash;&mdash;g it?</p>

<p>A. Because private marriage is become as common as

a man to ride a mile or two upon his neighbour’s mare, men
get will and wale of wives, the best portion, and properest person
is preferred, the first left the weak to the worst, and she
whom he does not love, he shutes away with his foot, and lies
down with whom he pleases.</p>

<p>Q. How will you know the bairns of our towns by all

if you go wrong curse the guide.</p>

<p>Q. Are young and old of them no better?</p>

his father’s a&mdash;.</p>

<p>Q. What sort of creatures is kindliest when they meet?</p>

<p>A. None can exceed the kindness of dogs when they meet
in a market.</p>

<p>Q. And what is collie’s kindness there?</p>

<p>A. First, they kiss others mouths and noses, smell all about,
and last of all, they are so kind as to kiss others below the tail.</p>

<p>Q. What is the coldest part of a dog?</p>

<p>A. His nose.</p>

<p>Q. What is the coldest part of a man?</p>

<p>A. His knees.</p>

<p>Q. What is the coldest part of a woman?</p>

<p>A. The back parts of her body.</p>

<p>Q. What is the reason, that these three parts of man,
woman, and dogs, are coldest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>A. Fabulous historian say that there was three little holes
in Noah’s Ark, and that the dog stopt his nose in one, and
the other the man put his knee in it, a third and biggest hole
broke, the woman bang’d her backside in it and these parts
being exposed to the cold blast, make them always cold ever
since.</p>

<p>Q. And what does the women do to warm their cold parts?</p>

<p>A. The married women turn their backsides to the goodman’s
belly; virgins and those going mad for marriage the
heat of their maidenhead keeps them warm, old matrons,
whirl’d o’er maidens, widow and widows bewitch’d hold up
their coldest parts to the fire.</p>

<p>Q. And what remedy does the poor dog take for his cold
nose?</p>

<p>A. Stops it below his tail the hottest bit in his body.</p>

<p>Q. What is the reason the dogs are worst on the chapmen,
than on other strange people?</p>

<p>A. It is said the dogs have three accusations against the
chapmen, handed down from father to son, or from one generation
of dogs to another; the first is as old as Æsop the great
wit of Babylon, the dog having a lawsuit against the cat, gained
the plea, and coming trudging home with the decree below his
tail a wicked chapman throwing his ellwan at him, he let it fa’
and so lost all his privileges thereby. The second is, because
in old times the chapmen used to buy dogs and kill them for
their skins. The third, when a chapman was quarterd in a
farmer’s house, that night the dog lost his property the licking
the pot.</p>

<p>Q. What creature resembles most a drunken piper?</p>

<p>A. A cat when she sips milk; she always sings, and so
does a piper when he drinks good ale.</p>

<p>Q. What is the reason a dog runs twice round about before
he ly down?</p>

<p>A. Because he does not know the head of his bed from the
foot of it.</p>

<p>Q. What creature resembles most a long lean, ill looking
greasy-fac’d lady for pride?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>A. None so much as the cat, who is continually spitting
in her lufe and rubbing her face, as many of such ladies do
the brown leather of their wrinkled chafts.</p>

<p>Q. Amongst what sort of creatures will you observe most
of a natural law?</p>

<p>A. The hart and the hind meet at one certain day in the
year; the brood goose, lays her first egg on Fasterns Even,
old stile; the crows begin to build their nest the first of March
old stile; the swans observe matrimony, and if the female die,
the male dares not take up with another or the rest will put
him to death; all the birds in general join in pairs and keep
so; but the dove resembles the adulterer, when the shoe-one
turns old, he puts her away, and takes another; the locusts
observe military order, and march in bands; the frogs resemble
pipers and preachers, for the young ride the old to
death.</p>

<p>Q. Who are the merriest and heartiest people in the world?</p>

<p>A. The sailors, for they’ll be singing and cursing one
another when the waves, their graves, are going over their
heads.</p>

<p>Q. Which are the disorderliest creatures in battle?</p>

<p>A. Cows and dogs for they all fall on them that are neath-most.</p>

<p>Q. Who are the vainest sort of people in the world?</p>

<p>A. A barber, a tailor, a young soldier, and a poor dominie.</p>

<p>Q. What is the great cause of the barber’s vanity?</p>

<p>A. His being admitted to trim noblemen’s chafts, thyke
their sculls, take kings by the nose, and hold a razor to his very
throat, which no other subject else dare do.</p>

<p>Q. What is the great cause of the tailor’s pride?</p>

<p>A. His making of peoples new clothes, of which every
person, young and old is proud of, then who can walk in a
vainer shew than a tailor carrying home a gentleman’s clothes.</p>

<p>Q. What is the cause of a young soldier’s pride?</p>

<p>A. When he lists, he thinks he is free from his mother’s
correction, the hard usage of a bad master, has a liberty to
curse, swear, whore, and do every thing; until he be con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>vinced
by four halberts and the drummer’s whip that he has
now got both a military and civil law above his head, and
perhaps worse masters than ever.</p>

<p>Q. What is the cause of the poor dominie’s pride?</p>

<p>A. As he is a teacher of the young and ignorant, he supposes
no man knows what he knows, the boys call him master
therefore he thinks himself a great man.</p>

<p>Q. What sort of a song is it that is sung without a tongue,
and its notes are understood by people of all nations?</p>

<p>A. It is a fart which every person knows to be but wind.</p>

<p>Q. What is the reason that young people are vain, giddy-headed,
and airy, and not so humble as the children of former
years?</p>

<p>A. Because they are brought up and educat after a more
haughty strain, by reading fables, plays, novels, and romances;
gospel books, such as the psalm-book, proverbs, and the catechisms
are like old almanacks; nothing in vogue, but fiddle,
flute, Troy and Babylonish tunes; our plain English corrupted
with beauish cants, dont, wont, nen, and ken, a jargon worse
than the Yorkshire dialect.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Q. Why is swearing become so common amongst the Scot
people?</p>

<p>A. Because so many lofty teachers come from the south
amongst us, where swearing is practised in its true grammatical
perfection, hot oaths, new struck, with as bright a lustre as
a new quarter guinea.</p>

<p>Q. How will you know the bones of a mason’s mare at the
back of a dyke amongst the bones of a hundred dead horses.</p>

<p>A. Because it is made of wood.</p>

<p>Q. Which are the two things not to be spared, but not to
be abused.</p>

<p>A. A soldier’s coat, and a hired horse.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Q. How is a man in debt like a nobleman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>A. Because he has many to wait on and call for him.</p>

<p>Q. How is swearing like a shabby coat?</p>

<p>A. Because it is a bad habit.</p>

<p>Q. How is a bad pen like a wicked and profligate man?</p>

<p>A. Because it wants mending.</p>

<p>Q. Why is a church bell like a story that is handed about?</p>

<p>A. Because it is often toll’d.</p>

<p>Q. What is a man like that is in the midst of a river and
cannot swim?</p>

<p>A. He is like to be drowned.</p>

<p>Q. Why is a drawn tooth like a thing that is forgot?</p>

<p>A. Because it is out of one’s head.</p>

<p>Q. Why is a book like a tree?</p>

<p>A. Because it is full of leaves.</p>

<p>Q. Why is a good sermon like a plump pudding?</p>

<p>A. Because there is reasons in it.</p>

<p>Q. How is a whorish woman like a charitable person?</p>

<p>A. Because she brings her husband to a piece of bread.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Q. How is a lawyer like a contentious person?</p>

<p>A. Because he breeds wrangling and jangling.</p>

<p>Q. Who is the greatest fool in the world?</p>

<p>A. A whore; for she hazards soul and body for a miserable
livelihood.</p>

<p>Q. Who are the two greatest thieves in Great Britain?</p>

<p>A. Tea and Tobacco, for they pick the pockets of the
whole nation.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between Ale-drapers and Linen-drapers?</p>

<p>A. Only this, the one cheats you with froth and the other
with cloth.</p>

<p>Q. If Extortioners cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
where will Usurers, Tallymen, and Pawn-brokers go?</p>

<p>A. The same road with Extortioners.</p>

<p>Q. What is the consequence of immoderate gaming?</p>

<p>A. By cards and dice, a man is ruin’d in a trice, for gaming
and whoring often hang together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Q. What employments are likest to one another?</p>

<p>A. Soldiers and Butchers are bloody near relations, for
they both live by slaughtering and killing.</p>

they are both good in their kind?</p>

<p>A. An hypocrite, who always look one way and rows another,
in all his transactions.</p>

<p>Q. What are the five greatest rarities to be found in the
world?</p>

<p>A. A black Swan, a Phœnix, an Unicorn, the Philosophers’

<p>Q. What is the greatest folly that sensible people can be
guilty of?</p>

<p>A. To go to law about trifles, for whatever way the plea
end, the lawyers will be the greatest gainers.</p>

<p>Q. Who has the honestest trade in the world?</p>

<p>A. Ballad-singers; for they always deal with ready-money:
and it is as ancient as the Siege of Troy, for Homer was a
ballad-singer.</p>

<p>Q. What is the surest method for one to become both rich
and respectable?</p>

<p>A. To be sober and industrious.</p>

<p>Q. What is the best method of overcoming the argument
of a positive person?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Good morrow, Sir, this is a very cold day.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, yesternight was a very cold
morning.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well brother traveller, of what nation art thou?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra dear shoy, I come from my own kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Why, Sir, I know that, but where is thy kingdom?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Allelieu dear honey, don’t you know Cork in
Ireland.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O you fool, Cork is not a kingdom, but a city.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Then dear shoy, I’m shure it is in a kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what is the reason you have come and left your
own dear country?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra dear honey, by shaint Patrick, they have got
such comical laws in our country, that they’ll put a man to
death in perfect health; so to be free and plain with you,
neighbour, I was obliged to come away, for I did not choose
to stay among such a people that can hang a poor man when
they please, if he either steals, robs, or kills a man.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Ay, but I take you to be more of an honest man,
than to steal, rob, or kill a man.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Honest, I am perfectly honest, when I was but a
child, my mother would have trusted me with a house full of
mill-stones.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What was the matter, was you guilty of nothing?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I did harm to nobody? but fancied
an old gentleman’s gun, and afterwards made it my own.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Very well boy, and did you keep it so?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Keep it, I would have kept it with all my heart
while I lived, death itself could not have parted us, but the old
rogue, the gentleman, being a justice of the peace himself, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
me tried for the rights of it, and how I came by it, and so took
it again.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you clear yourself without punishment?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I told him a parcel of lies, but they
would not believe me; for I said that I got it from my father
when it was a little pistol, and I had keeped it till it had grown
a gun, and was designed to use it well until it had grown a big
cannon, and then sell it to the military. They all fell a laughing
at me as I had been a fool, and bade me go home to my
mother and clean the potatoes.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> How long is it since you left your own country?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I do not mind whether it be a
fortnight or four months, but I think myself, it is a long time;
they tell me my mother is dead since, but I won’t believe it,
until I get a letter from her own hand, for she is a very good
scholar, suppose she can neither write nor read.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Was you ever in England before?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, that I was, and in Scotland too.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And were they kind to you when you was in Scotland?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> They were that kind, that they kick’t my arse for
me, and the reason was because I would not pay the whole of
the liquor that was drunk in the company, though the landlord
and his two sons got mouthful about of it; they would
have me pay it all, tho’ I did not drink it all, and I told
them it was a trick upon travellers, first to drink his liquor,
and then to kick him out of doors.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I really think they have used you badly, but could
you not beat them?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> That’s what I did, beat them all to their own contentment;
but there was one of them stronger than me, who
would have killed me, if the other two had not pulled me
away, and I had to run for it, till his passion was over; then
they made us drink and gree again; we shook hands, and
made a bargain, never to harm other more; but this bargain
did not last long, for, as I was kissing his mouth, by shaint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Patrick, I bit his nose, which caused him to beat me very sore
for my pains.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well Pady, what calling was you when in Scotland.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why sir, I was no business at all, but what do you
call the green tree that’s like a whin bush, many people makes
a thing to sweep the house of it!</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O yes Pady, they call it a broom.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, ay, you have it, then I was a gentleman’s
broom, only waited on his horses, and washed the dishes for
the cook; and when my master rode a hunting, I ran behind
along with the dogs.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O yes, Pady, it was a groom you mean, but I fancy
you was cook’s mate, or kitchen-boy.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> No, no, it was the broom that I was, and if I had
staid there till now, I might have been advanced as high as
my master, for the ladies loved me so well, that they laughed
at me.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> They might admire you for a fool.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> What sir, do you imagine that I am not a fool, no,
no, my master asked counsel of me in all his matters, and I
always gave him a reason for every thing: I told him one
morning that he went too soon to the hunting, that the hares
were not got out of their beds; and neither the barking of
horns nor the blowing of dogs, could make them rise, it was
such a cold morning that night; so they all ran away that we
catched, when we did not see them. Then my master told my
words to several gentlemen that was at dinner with him, and
they admired me for want of wisdom, saying, I was certainly
a man of great judgement, for my head was all of a lump,
added, they were going a-fishing along with my master and
me in the afternoon; but I told them it was a very unhappy
thing for any man to go a hunting in the morning and a fishing
in the afternoon; yet they would try it, but they had
better staid at home, for it came on a most terrible fine night
of south-west rain and even-down-wind: so the fishes got all
below the water to keep them dry from the shower, and we
catched them all, but got none of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how long did you serve that gentleman, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I was with him six weeks, and he
beat me seven times.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> For what did he beat you? was it for your madness
and foolish tricks?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear shoy, it was not; but for being too inquisitive
and going sharply about business. First, he sent me to the
post-office, to enquire if there was any letters for him: so
when I came there, said I, is there any letters here for my
master to-day? Then they asked who was my master; sir,
said I, it is very bad manners in you to ask any gentleman’s
name: at this they laughed, mocking me, and said they
could give me none, if I would not tell my master’s name: so
I returned to my master, and told the impudence of the fellow,
how he would give me no letters unless I would tell him your
name, master. My master at this flew in a great passion,
and kicked me down stairs, saying, Go you rogue and tell my
name directly, how can the gentleman give letters, when he
knows not who is asking for them! Then I returned and told
my master’s name, so they told me there was one for him, I
looked at it, but being very small, and asking the price of it;
they told me it was sixpence! sixpence, said I, will you take
sixpence for that small thing, and selling bigger ones for twopence;
faith I am not such a big fool; you think to cheat me,
now, this is not a conscionable way of dealing, I’ll acquaint
my master of it first; so I came and told my master how
they would have sixpence for his letter and was selling bigger
ones for twopence; he took up my head and broke his cane
with it, calling me a thousand fools, saying, the man was more
just, than to take any thing but the right for it: but I was
sure there was none of the right buying and selling such
dear penny-worths: So I came again for my dear sixpence
letter; and as the fellow was shuffling through a parcel of
them, seeking for it again, to make the best of a dear market,
I pick’t up two, and home I comes to my master, thinking he
would be well pleased with what I had done, now, said I,
master, I think I have put a trick on them fellows, for selling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the letter to you: What have you done? said he, said I, I
have only taken other two letters; here’s one for you, master,
to help your dear penny-worth, and I’ll send the other to
my mother to see whether she be dead or alive, for she’s
always angry I don’t write to her: I had not the word well
spoken, till he got up his stick and beat me heartily for it,
and sent me back to the fellows again with the two: I had
a very ill will to go, but nobody would buy them of me by
the way.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> A well, Pady, I think you was to blame, and your
master too, for he ought to have taught you how to have gone
about those affairs, and not beat you so.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I had too much wit of my own to
be teached by him, or any body else; he began to instruct me
after that, how I should serve the table, and such nasty things
as those: one night I took ben a roasted fish in one hand, and
a piece of bread in the other; the old gentleman was so saucy
he would not take it, and told me, I should bring nothing
to him without a trencher below it: the same night as he was
going to bed, he called for his slippers and pish-pot, so I clapt
a trencher below the pish-pot, and another below the slippers,
and ben I goes, one in every hand: no sooner did I enter the
room, than he threw the pish-pot at me which broke both my
head and the pish-pot at one blow: now, said I, the devil is in
my master altogether, for what he commands at one time he
countermands at another. Next day I went with him to the
market to buy a sack of potatoes, I went to the potatoe-monger,
and asked what he took for the full of a Scot’s cog, he weighed
them in, he asked no less than fourpence; fourpence, said I, if
I were but in Dublin, I could get the full of that for nothing,
and in Cork and Kinsale far cheaper; them is but small things
like pease, said I, but the potatoes in my country is as big as
your head, fine meat, all made up in blessed mouthfuls; the
potatoe-merchant called me a liar, and my master called me a
fool, so the one fell a-kicking me, and the other a cuffing me,
I was in such bad bread among them, that I called myself both
a liar and a fool to get off alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you carry <ins class="corr" id="tn-186" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'your potates home'">
your potatoes home</ins> from the market?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I carried the horse and them both,
besides a big loaf, and two bottles of wine: for I put the old
horse on my back, and drove the potatoes before me: and
when I tied the load to the loaf, I had nothing to do but to
carry the bottle in my hand: but bad luck to the way as I
came home, for a nail out of the heal of my foot sprung a leak
in my brogue, which pricked the very bone, bruised the skin,
and made my brogue itself to blood: and I having no hammer
by me, but a hatchet I left at home, I had to beat down the
nail with the bottom of the bottle: and by the book, dear
shoy, it broke to pieces, and scattered the wine in my mouth.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you recompense your master for the
loss of your bottle of wine?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra dear shoy, I had a mind to cheat him, and myself
too, for I took the bottle to a blacksmith, and desired him
to mend it, that I might go to the butcher and get it full of
bloody water, but he told me he could not work in any thing
but steel and iron. Arra, said I, if I were in my own kingdom,
I could get a blacksmith who would make a bottle out
of a stone, and a stone out of nothing.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you trick your master out of it?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why the old rogue began to chide me, asking me
what way I broke it, then I held up the other as high as my
head, and let it fall to the ground on a stone, which broke it
all in pieces likewise: now, said I, master, that’s the way, and
then he beat me very heartily, until I had to shout out mercy
and murder all at once.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Why did you not leave him when he used you so
badly.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I could never think to leave him
while I could eat, he gave me so many good victuals, and promised
to prefer me to be his own bone-picker. But by shaint
Patrick, I had to run away with my life or all was done, else
I had lost my dear shoul and body too by him, and then I
came home much poorer than I went away. The great big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
bitch dog which was my master’s best beloved, put his head
into a pitcher to lick out some milk, and when it was in he
could not get it out, and I to save the pitcher got the hatchet
and cut off the dog’s head, and then I had to break the pitcher
to get out the head; by this I lost both the dog and the
pitcher. My master, hearing of this, swore he would cut the
head off me, for the poor dog was made useless, and could not
see to follow any body for want of his eyes: And when I
heard of this, I ran away with my own head, for if I had
wanted it I had lost my eyes too, then I would not have seen
the road <ins class="corr" id="tn-187" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to Port Partrick'">
to Port Patrick</ins>, through Glen-nap, but by shaint
Patrick I came home alive in spite of them all.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O rarely done Pady, you behaved like a man, but
what is the reason that you Irish people swear always by
shaint Patrick, what is this shaint Patrick?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, he was the best shaint in the
world, the father of all good people in the kingdom, he has a
great kindness for an Irishman, when he hears him calling
on his name; he was the first that sow’d the potatoes in
Ireland, for he knew it was a bit of good fit ground, it being a
gentleman’s garden before Noah’s flood.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> But dear Pady, is shaint Patrick yet alive, that he
hears the Irish people when they speak of his name?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I don’t know whether he be dead
or alive, but it’s a long time since they killed him, the people
turned all heathens, for he would not change his profession, and
was going to run the country with it, and for taking his gospel
away to England, so the barbarous tories of Dublin cutted off
his head, and what do you think he did when his head was off?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What could a dead man do you fool?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dead, faith he was not such a big fool as to die yet,
he swimmed over to England after this, and brought his head
along with him.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did he carry his head and swim too?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, he carried his head in his teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> No, Pady, it won’t hold, I must have caution for
that.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> If you won’t believe me, I’ll swear it over again.</p>

<h3 class="lsp2">PART II.</h3>
</div>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you get safe out of Scotland at last?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> By the law dear honey, when I came to Port Patrick,
and saw my own kingdom, I thought I was safe at home, but
I was clean dead and almost drowned before I could get
riding over the water: for I, with nine passengers more, leapt
in a little young boat, having but four men dwelling in a little
house, in the one end of it, which was all thacked with deals:
and after they had pulled up her tether-stick, and laid her
long halter over her mane, they pulled up a long big sheet
like three pair of blankets to the riggen of the house, and the
wind blew in that, which made her gallop up one hill and
down another, till I thought she would have run to the world’s
end if some part of the world had not catch’t her by the foot.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I fancy, Pady, you was by this time very sick?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Sick, ay sick beyond all sickness, clean dead as a
door-nail; for as I had lost the key of my backside, I bock’d
up the very bottom of my belly, and I thought that liver and
lungs, and all that I had should have gone together; then I
called to the fellow that held by her tail behind, to pull down
his sheet and hold her head, till I got leasure to die, and then
say my prayers.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well then, Pady, and got you safe ashore at last?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, we came ashore very fast; but, by shaint
Patrick, I shall never venture my dear shoul and body in
such a young boat again, while the wind blows out of Scots
Galloway.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well, Pady, and where did you go when you came
to Ireland again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra dear honey, and where did I go, but to my
own dear cousin, who was now become very rich by the death
of the old buck his father: who died but a few weeks before
I went over, and the parish had to bury him out of pity, it
did not cost him a farthing.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what entertainment or good usage did you get
there, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> O my dear shoy, I was kindly used as another
gentleman, for I told him I had made something of it, by my
travels, as well as himself, but I had got no money, therefore
I had to work for my victuals while I staid with him.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Ho, poor Pady, I suppose you would not stay long
there.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I could have staid there long
enough, but when a man is poor his friends think little of
him: I told him I was going to see my brother Harry: Harry,
said he, is dead: dead said I, and who killed him? Why
said he, death: Allelieu, dear honey, and where did he kill
him? said I. In his bed, said he; O what for a cowardly
action was that, said I, to kill a man in his bed: and what is
this fellow death? said I. What is he, He is one that kills
more than the head butcher in all Cork does. Arra, dear
honey, said I, if he had been upon Newry mountains with his
brogues on, and his broad sword by his side, all the deaths in
Ireland had not have killed him: O that impudent fellow
death, if he had let him alone till he died for want of butter
milk and potatoes, I am sure he had lived all the days of his
life.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> In all your travels when abroad, did you never see
any of your countrymen, to inform you of what happened at
home concerning your relations?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra dear shoy, I saw none but Tom Jack one day
in the street; but when I came to him, it was not him, but
one just like him.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> On what account did you go a travelling?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why, a decruiting sergeant listed me to be a captain,
and after all advanced me no higher than a soldier itself, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
only he called me his dear countryman recruit: for I did not
know what the regiment was when I saw them; I thought
they were all gentlemen’s sons and collegeoners, when I saw
a box like a bible upon their bellies: until I saw K for King
George upon it, and R for God bless him: ho, ho, said I, I
shan’t be long here.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then Pady, you deserted from them?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ah that’s what I did, and run to the mountains like
a wild buck, and ever since when I see any soldiers I close
my eyes, lest they should look and know me.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what exploits did you do when you were a soldier?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I killed a man.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you that?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, when he dropt his sword, I drew
mine, and advanced boldly to him, and then cutted off his foot.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then what a big fool was you; for you ought first
to have cut off his head.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, his head was cutted off before I
engaged him, else I had not done it.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then Pady, you acted like a fool; but you are not
such a big fool as many take you to be, you might pass for a
philosopher.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> A fulusifair, my father was a fulusifair, besides he
was a man under great authority by law, condemning the just
and clearing the guilty: do you know how they call the
horse’s mother?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Why they call her a mare.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> A mare, ay very well minded, by shaint Patrick, my
father was a mare in Cork.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what riches was left you by the death of your
mother?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> A bad luck to her old barren belly, for she lived in
great plenty, and died in great poverty: devoured up all or
she died, but two hens and a pockful of potatoes, a poor estate
for an Irish gentleman, in faith.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what did you make of your hens and potatoes,
did you sow them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I sowed them in my belly, and
sold the hens to a cadger.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what business did your mother follow after?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Greatly in the merchant way.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what sort of goods did she deal in?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear honey, she went through the country and sold
small fishes, onions and apples: bought hens and eggs, and
then hatched them herself. I remember one long-necked
cock she had of an oversea brood, that stood on the midden
and picked all the stars out of the north-west so they were
never so thick there since.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Now Pady, that’s a bull surpasses all: but is there
none of that cock’s offspring alive in Ireland now?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I don’t think that there are, but it
is a pity but they had, for they would fly with people above
the sea, which would put the use of ships out of fashion, and
then there would be nobody drowned at sea at all.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Very well Pady: but in all your travels did you
ever get a wife?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay that’s what I did, and wicked wife too.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what is become of her now?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear shoy, I can’t tell whether she is gone to Purgatory,
or the parish of Pig-trantrum: for she told me she
should certainly die the first opportunity she could get, as this
present evil world was not worth the waiting on, so she would
go and see what good things is in the world to come; and so
when that old rover called the Fever, came raging like a madman
over the whole kingdom, knocking the people on the
head with deadly blows, she went away and died out of spite,
leaving me with nothing but two motherless children.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O, but Pady, you ought to have gone to a doctor,
and got some pills and physic for her.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> By shaint Patrick I had as good a pill of my
own as any doctor in the kingdom could give her, and as
for sneeshing, she could never use snuff nor tobacco in her
life.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O you fool that is not what I mean; you ought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
have brought the doctor to feel her pulse, and let blood of her
if he thought it needful.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Yes, that’s what I did; for I ran to the doctor whenever
she died, and sought something for a dead or dying
woman; the old foolish devil was at his dinner, and began to
ask me some dirty questions, which I answered distinctly.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what did he ask, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why, he asked me, How did my wife go to stool?
to which I answered, the same way that other women go to a
chair: no, said he, that’s not what I mean, how does she
purge? Arra, Mr. Doctor, said I, all the fire in Purgatory
wont purge her clean; for she has both a cold and stinking
breath. Sir, said he, that is not what I ask you, whether does
she shit thick or thin? Arra, Mr. Doctor, said I, it is sometimes
so thick and hard that you may take it in your hand,
and eat it like a piece of cheese or pudding, and at other
times you may drink it, or sup it with a spoon. At this he
flew in a most terrible rage, and kicked me down stairs, and
would give me nothing to her, but called me a dirty scoundrel
for speaking of shit before ladies.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And was you sorry when your wife died?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, if any body had beat me, I was fit
to cry myself.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And in what good order did you bury your wife
when she died?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> O my dear shoy she was buried in all manner of
pomp, pride, and splendour; a fine coffin with cords in it, and
within the coffin along with herself, she got a pair of new
brogues, a penny candle, a good hard-headed old hammer,
with an Irish sixpenny piece, to pay her passage at the gate
and what more could she look for.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I really think you gave her enough along with her,
but you ought to have cried for her, if it was no more but to
be in the fashion.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> And why should I cry without sorrow? when we
hired two criers to cry all the way before her to keep in the
fashion.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what do they cry before a dead woman?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why they cry the common cry, or funeral lament
that is used in our Irish country.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what manner of cry is that, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear Tom, if you don’t know, I’ll tell you, when any
dies, there is a number of criers goes before, saying, Luff, fuff,
fou, allelieu, dear honey, what aileth thee to die! it was not
for want of good buttermilk and potatoes.</p>

<h3 class="lsp2">PART III.</h3>
</div>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well Pady, and what did you do when your wife
died?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear honey, what would I do: do you think I was
such a big fool as to die too, I am sure, If I had I would not
have got fair play, when I am not so old yet as my father was
when he died.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> No, Pady, it is not that I mean, was you sorry, or
did you weep for her?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Weep for her; by shaint Patrick I would not weep
nor yet be sorry, suppose my own mother and all the women
in Ireland had died seven years before I was born.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What did you do with your children when she died?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Do you imagine I was such a big fool as bury my
children alive, along with a dead woman: Arra, dear honey,
we always commonly give nothing along with a dead person,
but an old shirt, a winding sheet, a big hammer, with a long
candle, and an Irish silver three-penny piece?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Dear Pady, and what use do they make of all them
things?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Then, Tom, since you are so inquisitive, you must
go ask the priest.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What did you make of your children then Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> And what should I make of them, do you imagine
that I should give them into the hands of the butchers, as they
had been a parcel of young hogs: by shaint Patrick, I had
more unnaturality in me, than to put them in an hospital as
others do.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> No, I suppose you would leave them with your
friends?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, ay, a poor man’s friends is sometimes worse
than a profest enemy: the best friend I ever had in the world
was my own pocket while my money lasted; but I left two
babes between the priest’s door and the parish church, because
I thought it was a place of mercy, and then set out for England
in quest of another fortune.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And did you not take good-night with your friends
ere you came away?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I had no friends in the world but
an Irish half-crown, and I would have been very sorry to
parted with such a dear pocket-companion at such a time.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I fancy Pady, you’ve come off with what they call a
moon-shine flitting.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> You lie like a thief now, for I did not see sun, moon,
nor stars, all the night then: for I set out from Cork at the
dawn of night, and I had travelled twenty miles all but twelve,
before gloaming in the morning.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And where did you go to take shipping?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I came to a country village called
Dublin, as a big a city as any market-town in all England,
where I got myself abroad of a little young boat, with a parcel
of fellows, and a long leather bag, I supposed them to be
tinkers, until I asked what they carried in that leather sack;
they told me it was the English mail they were going over
with: then said I, is the milns so scant in England, that they
must send over their corn to Ireland to grind it; the comical
cunning fellows persuaded me it was so; then I went down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
to a little house below the water, hard by the rigg-back of the
boat, and laid me down on their leather sack, where I slept
myself almost to death with hunger. And dear Tom, to tell
you plainly, when I awaked I did not know where I was, but
thought I was dead and buried, for I found nothing all round
me but wooden walls and timber above.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you come to yourself, to know where
you was at last.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> By the law, dear shoy, I scratched my head in a
hundred parts, and then set me down to think upon it, so I
minded it was my wife that was dead, and not me, and that I
was alive in the young post boat, with the fellows that carries
over English meal from the Irish milns.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then, Pady, I am sure yon was glad when you
found yourself alive?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I was very sure I was alive, but I
did not think to live long, so I thought it was better for me
to steal and be hanged, than to live all my days, and die
directly with hunger at last.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What, had you no meat nor money along with you?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I gave all the money to the captain
of the house or gudeman of the ship, to carry me into the sea,
or over to England, and when I was like to eat my old brogues
for want of victuals, I drew my hanger and cut their leather
sack thinkin’ to get a lick of their meal; but allelieu, dear
shoy, I found nothing, meal nor seeds, but a parcel of papers
and letters, a poor morsel indeed for a hungry man.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then Pady you laid down your honesty for nothing.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, ay, I was a great theif, but got nothing to steal.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how did you come to get victuals at last?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Allelieu, dear honey, the thoughts of meat and drink,
death and life, and every thing else, was out of my mind, I
had not a thought but one.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what was that Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> To go down among the fishes and become a whale;
then I would have lived an easy life all my days, having nothing
to do but drink salt water, and eat caller oysters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What Pady, was you like to be drowned again?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, ay, drowned, as cleanly drowned as a fish, for
the sea blew very loud, and the wind ran so high, that we were
all cast away safe on shore, and not one of us drowned at all.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And where did you go when you came on shore?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I was not able to go any where,
you might cast a knot on my belly, I was so hollow in my
middle so I went into a gentleman’s house and told him the
bad fortune I had of being drowned between Ireland and the
foot of his garden; where we came all safe ashore. But all
the comfort I got from him was a word of truth.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what was that Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Why he told me if I had been a good boy at home:
I needed not to have gone so far to push my fortune with an
empty pocket; to which I answered, and what magnifies that,
as long as I am a good workman at no trade at all.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I suppose, Pady, the gentleman would make you
dine with him?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> I really thought I was, when I saw them roasting
and skinning so many black chickens which was nothing but
a few dead crows they were going to eat; ho, ho, said I, them
is but dry meat at the best, of all the fowls that flie, commend
me to the wing of an ox: but all that came to my share, was
a piece of boiled herring and a roasted potatoe, that was the
first bit of bread I ever eat in England.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well, Pady, what business did you follow after in
England, when you was so poor?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> What sir, do you imagine I was poor when I came
over on such an honourable occasion as to list, and bring
myself to no preferment at all. As I was an able bodied man
in the face, I thought to be made a brigadeer, a grandedeer,
or a fuzeleer, or even one of them blew gowns that holds the
fiery stick to the bung-hole of the big cannons, when they let
them off, to fright away the French; I was as sure as no man
alive ere I came from Cork, the least preferment I could get,
was to be riding-master to a regiment of marines, or one of
the black horse itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well Pady, you seem to be a very clever man, to be
all in one body, what height are you?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I am five foot nothing, all but one
inch.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And where in England was it you listed?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I was going through that little
country village, the famous city of Chester, the streets was
very sore by reason of the hardness of my feet, and lameness
of my brogues, so I went but very slowly a-cross the
streets, from port to port is a pretty long way, but I being
weary thought nothing of it: then the people came all crowding
to me as I had been a world’s wonder, or the wandering
Jew: For the rain blew in my face, and the wind wetted all
my belly, which caused me to turn the backside of my coat
before, and my buttons behind, which was a good safeguard to
my body, and the starvation of my naked back: as I had not
a good shirt.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> I am sure then, Pady, they would take you for a fool?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> No, no, sir, they admired me for my wisdom, for I
always turned my buttons before, when the wind blew on
behind, but I wondered greatly how the people knew my
name, and where I came from: for every one told another,
that was Pady from Cork: I suppose they knew my face by
seeing my name in the newspapers.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Well, Pady, what business did you follow in Chester?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> To be sure I was not idle, working at nothing at all,
until a decruiting sergeant came to town with two or three
fellows along with him, one beating on a fiddle, and another
playing on a drum, tossing their airs thro’ the street, as if they
were going to be married: and I saw them courting none but
young men; so to bring myself to no preferment at all, I listed
for a soldier because I was too high for a grandedeer.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what listing money did you get, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I got five thirteens and a pair of
English brogues; the guinea and the rest of the gold was sent
away to London, to the King my master, to buy me new
shirts, a cockade, and common treasing for my hat, they made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
me swear the malicious oath of devilrie against the King, the
colours, and my captain, telling me if ever I desert and not
run away, that I should be shot, and then whipt to death,
through the regiment.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> No Pady: it is first whipt and then shot you mean.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, it is all one thing at last, but it is
best to be shot and then whipt, the cleverest way to die, I’ll
warrant you.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> How much pay did you get, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Do you know the little tall fat seargeant that feed
me to be a soldier?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how should I know them I never saw, you fool?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Dear shoy, you may know him whether you see him
or not! for his face is all bored in big holes with the small
pox, his nose is the colour of a lobster-toe, and his chin like a
well washen potatoe: he’s the biggest rogue in our kingdom,
you’ll know him when he cheats you, and the wide world;
and another mark, he dights his mouth before he drinks, and
blows his nose before he takes a snuff; the rogue height me
sixpence a day, kill or no kill: and when I laid Sunday and
Saturday both together, and all the days in one day, I can’t
make a penny above fivepence of it.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> You should have kept an account, and asked your
arrears once a month.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> That’s what I did, but he read a paternoster, out of
his prayer book, wherein all our names are written; so much
for a stop-hold to my gun, to bucklers, to a pair of comical
harn-hose, with leather buttons from top to toe; and worst of
all, he would have no less than a penny a week to a doctor;
arra, said I, I never had a sore finger nor yet a sick toe, all
the days of my life, then what have I to do with the doctor,
or the doctor to do with me?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And did he make you pay all these things?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Ay, ay, pay and better pay; he took me before his
captain, who made me pay all was in his book. Arra, master
captain, said I, you are a comical sort of a fellow now, you
might as well make me pay for my coffin before I be dead, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
to pay for a doctor before I be sick; to which he answered in
a passion, sirra, said he, I have seen many a better man
buried without a coffin: sir, said I, then I’ll have a coffin, die
when I will, if there be as much wood in all the world, or I
shall not be buried at all. Then he called for the sergeant,
saying, you, sir, go and buy that man’s coffin, and put it in the
store till he die, and stop sixpence a week off his pay for it:
No, no, sir, said I, I’ll rather die without a coffin; and seek
none when I’m dead; but if you are for clipping another sixpence
off my poor pay, keep it all to yourself, and I’ll swear
all your oaths of agreement we had back again, and then seek
soldiers where you will.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O then Pady, how did you end the matter?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear shoy, by the mights of shaint Patrick
and help of my own brogues, I both ended it, and mended it,
for the next night before that, I gave them leg bail for my
fidelity, and then went about the country a fortune-teller,
dumb and deaf as I was not.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> How old was you Pady when you was a soldier last?</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> Arra, dear honey, I was three dozen all but two, and
it is only but two years since, so I want only four years of
three dozen yet, and when I live six dozen more, I’ll be older
than I am, I’ll warrand you.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O but Pady, by your account, you are three dozen
of years old already.</p>

<p><em>Teag.</em> O what for a big fool are you now Tom, when you
count the years I lay sick; which time I count no time at all.</p>


<div class="chapter" id="tcs-IV">
<h3>A NEW CATECHISM, &amp;c.</h3>
</div>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Of all the opinions professed in religion tell me now,
Pady, of what profession art thou?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, my religion was too weighty a
matter to carry out of my own country: I was afraid that you
English Presbyterians should pluck it away from me.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What, Pady, was your religion such a load that you
could not carry it along with you?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Yes, that it was, but I carried it always about with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
me when at home, my sweet cross upon my dear breast, bound
to my dear button hole.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what manner of worship did you perform by
that?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Why I adored my cross, the pope, and the priest,
cursed Oliver, as black as a crow, and swears myself a cut throat
against all Protestants and church of Englandmen.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what is the matter but you would be a church
of Englandman, or a Scotch Presbyterian yourself, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Because it is unnatural for an Irishman, but had
shaint Patrick been a Presbyterian, I had been the same.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And for what reason would you be a Presbyterian
then, Pady?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Because they have a liberty to eat flesh in lent, and
every thing that’s fit for the belly.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What, Pady, are you such a lover of flesh that you
would change your profession for it?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> O yes, that’s what I did, I love flesh of all kinds,
sheep’s beef, swine’s mutton, hare’s flesh, and hen’s venison;
but our religion is one of the hungriest in all the world, ah!
but it makes my teeth to weep, and my belly to water, when
I see the Scotch Presbyterians and English churchmen, in
time of lent, feeding upon bull’s bastards, and sheep’s young
children.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> Why Pady, do you say the bull is a fornicator, and
gets bastards?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I never saw the cow and her husband,
all the days of my life, nor before I was born, going to
the church to be married, and what then can his sons and
daughters be but bastards?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> O Pady, Pady, the cow is but a cow, but and so are
you: but what reward will you get when you are dead, for
punishing your belly so while you are alive?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> By shaint Patrick I’ll live like a king when I’m
dead, for I will neither pay for meat nor drink.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What, Pady, do you think that you are to come alive
again when you are dead?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> O yes, we that are true Roman Catholicks we will
live a long time after we are dead; when we die in love with
the priests, and the good people of our profession.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what assurance can your priests give you of that?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, our priest is a great shaint, and a
good shoul, who can repeat a patter-noster, and Ave Maria,
which will fright the very horned devil himself and make him
run for it, until he be like to fall and break his neck.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what does he give you when you are dying that
makes you come alive again?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Why he writes a letter upon our tongues, sealed
with a wafer, gives us a sacrament in our mouth, with a pardon,
and direction in our right-hand, who to call for at the ports
of Purgatory?</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And to whom do they direct the dead?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Why the English Romans when they die are all directed
to shaint George, the Scots to shaint Andrew, the Welch
to shaint David, and our own dear countrymen must every
shoul of them go to shaint Patrick, but them that have no money
to pay the priest for a pardon, or those that are drown’d or
die by themselves in the fields without a priest, is lost, and
sent away as black-guard scoundrels, to wander up and down
while the world stands, among the brownies, fairies, mermaids,
sea-devils, and water kelpies.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what money design you to give the priests for
your pardon?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Dear shoy, I wish I had first the money he would
take for it, I would rather drink it myself, and then give him
both my bill and my honest word, payable in the other world.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And how then are you to get a passage to the other
world, or who is to carry you there?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> O my dear shoy, Tom, you know nothing of the
matter; for, when I die, they will bury my body, flesh, blood,
dirt and bones, only my skin will be blown up full of wind
and spirit, my dear shoul I mean; and then I will be blown
over to the other world, on the wings of the wind; and after
that I shall never be kill’d hang’d nor drowned, nor yet die<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
in my bed, for when any hits me a blow, my new body will
play buff upon it like a bladder.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> But what way will you go to the new world, or
where is it?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, the priest knows where it is, but I
do not, but the Pope of Rome keeps the outer-port, shaint
Patrick the inner-port, and gives us a direction of the way to
shaint Patrick’s palace, which stands on the head of the
Stalian-loch, where I’ll have no more to do but chap at the
gate.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What is the need for chapping at the gate, is it not
always open?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Dear Shoy, you know little about it, for there is
none can enter in but red-hot Irishmen, for when I call, “Allelieu,
dear honey, shaint Patrick countenance your own dear countryman
if you will.” Then the gates will be opened directly to me,
for he knows and loves an Irishman’s voice, as he loves his
own heart.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what entertainment will you get when you are in?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> O my dear, we are all kept there until a general
review, which is commonly once in the week; and then we are
drawn up, like as many young recruits, and all the black-guard
scoundrels is pickt out of the ranks, and one half of them is
sent away to the Elysian fields, to curry the weeds from
among the potatoes, the other half of them to the river Sticks,
to catch fishes for shaint Patrick’s table; and all them that is
owing the priests any money, is put in the black hole, and then
given into the hands of a great black bitch of a devil which
they keep for a hangman, who whips them up and down the
smoaky dungeon every morning for six months, then holds
their bare back-side to a great fire, until their hips be all in one
blister, and after all, they are sent away to the poor parish of
Pig-trantum, where they get nothing to eat but cold sowens,
burgue, and butter-milk.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And where does your good people go when they are
separated from the bad?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> And where would you have them to go, but unto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
shaint Patrick’s palace, and then they may go down the back
stairs into the garden of Eden, now called Paradise: ah! my
dear shoy, this is the real fundamental truths of our Romish
Religion, and a deep doctrine it is, but your Presbyterians and
English churchmen will not believe it, and, by shaint Patrick,
neither can I, until I see more of it come to pass.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> And what manner of life does your priest ordain you
to live in the world to come?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, if I had money enough to buy
pardons from our priest, I might commit all the lies forbidden
in the holy books, as he gives them a toleration to lie and
cheat all the world, but those of our own profession.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What, Pady, are you not to do as much justice to a
Protestant as a Papist?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> O my dear shoy, the most justice we are commanded
to do to a Protestant, is to whip and torment them until they
confess themselves in the Romish Faith, and then cut their
throats that they may die believers.</p>

<p><em>Tom.</em> What business do you follow after at present?</p>

<p><em>Pady.</em> Arra, dear shoy, I am a mountain sailor, and my
supplication is as follows,</p>

<p class="noindent">Good Christian people behold me a man! who has com’d
thro’ a world of wonders, a hell full of hardships, dangers
by sea, and dangers by land, and yet I am alive, you may see
my hand crooked like a fowl’s foot, and that is no wonder at
all, considering my sufferings and sorrows: Oh! oh! oh!
good people I was a man in my time who had plenty of the
gold, plenty of the silver, plenty of the clothes, plenty of the
butter, the beer, beef, and bisket. And now, now I have
nothing: being taken by the Turks and relieved by the
Spaniards, lay sixty-six days at the siege of Gibraltar, and
got nothing to eat but sea wreck and raw mussels; then put
to sea for our safety, cast upon the Barbarian coast among the
woful wicked Algerines, where we were taken, and tied with
tugs and tadders, horse-locks and cow-chains: then cut and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
custrate yard and testicles quite away, if you will not believe,
put in your hand and feel how every female’s made smooth
by the sheer-bone, where nothing is to be seen but what is
natural. Then made our escape to the desert wild wilderness
of Arabia: where we lived amongst the wild asses, upon wind,
sand, and sapless ling. Afterwards put to sea in the hull of an
old house; where we was tossed above and below the clouds,
being driven thro’ thickets and groves by fierce, coarse,
calm and contrary winds; at last, was cast away upon Salisbury
plains, where our vessel was dash’d to pieces against a
cabbage-stock. And now my humble petition to you good
Christian people is, for one hundred of your beef, one hundred
of your butter, another of your cheese, a cask of your bisket,
a tun of your beer, a keg of your rum, with a pipe of your
wine, a lump of your gold, a piece of your silver, a few of your

<p class="p2 center">THE COMICAL HISTORY OF
SIMPLE JOHN AND HIS TWELVE MISFORTUNES.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Simple John was a widow’s son, and a coarse country weaver
to his trade; he made nothing but such as canvas for caff-beds,
corn and coal-sacks, druggit and harn was the finest
webs he could lay his fingers to; he was a great lump of a lang
lean lad, aboon sax fit high afore he was aughteen year auld,
and as he said himsel he grew sae fast and was in sic a hurry
to be high, that he did not stay to bring a’ his judgment wi’
him, but yet he hoped it would follow him, and he would
meet wi’t as mony a are does after they’re married; he had
but ae sister, and she had as little sense as himsel, she was
married on Sleeky Willy, the wylie weaver, his mither was a
rattling rattle-scul’d wife, and they lived a’ in ae house, and
every body held them as a family of fools. When John came
to man’s state, to the age of twenty-one years, he tell’d his
mither he would hae a wife o’ some sort, either young or auld,
widow or lass, if they had but head and hips, tongue and tail,
he shou’d tak them, and weel I wat mither, quoth he, they’ll
get a lumping penny-worth o’ me, get me wha will.</p>

<p>His mither tells him o’ the black butcher on Ti’ot-side, who
had three dochters, and every ane of them had something,
there was Kate, Ann, and Girzy, had hunder merks the piece,
Kate and Ann had both bastards. Girzy the eldest had a
hump back, a high breast, baker legs, a short wry neck,
thrawn mouth, and goggle ey’d, a perfect Æsop of the female
kind, with as many crooked conditions within as without, a
very lump of loun-like ill nature, row’d a’ together, as if she
had been nine months in a haggies, a second edition of crooked
backed Richard an old English king, that was born wi’ teeth
to bite a’ round about him; and yet the wight gaed mad to
be married.</p>

<p>John’s mother tell’d him the road where to go, and what to
say, and accordingly he sets out wi’ his sunday’s coat on, and
a’ his braws, and a pair o’ new pillonian breeks o’ his mither’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
making. In he comes and tell’d his errand before he would
sit down, says good day to you goodman, what are you a’
doing here? I am wanting a wife, an’ ye’re a flesher and has
a gude sorting aside you, my mither says ye can sair me or
ony body like me, what say ye till’t goodman, how mony
dochters hae ye? are they a’ married yet? I fain wou’d tak a
look o’ some o’ them gin ye like.</p>

<p>A wow said the goodwife come in by honest lad and rest
you, an ye be a wooer sit down an gi’s a snuff; a deed goodwife
I hae nae mill but my mither’s, and it’s at hame. A
whar win ye, I’se no ken ye; I wat quoth he, my name’s
Jock Sandeman, they ca’ me simple John the sack weaver,
I hae nae tocher but my loom, a pirn wheel, a kettle pat, a
brass pan, twa piggs, four cogs and a candlestick, a good cock,
a cat, two eerocks new begun to lay; my sister Sara is
married on sleeky Willie the wylie weaver, and I maun hae a
hagwife or my mither die, for truly she’s very frail, and ony
harle o’ health she has is about dinner-time; what say ye
till’t, goodman? can ye buckle me or no?</p>

<p>Goodman. A dear John ye’re in an unco haste, ye wadna
hae you’re wife hame wi’ ye? they’re a’ there before ye, which
o’ them will ye tak?</p>

<p>Hout tout says John, ony o’ them ’ill sare me, but my
mither says there’s twa o’ them has fauts: and what is their
fauts said the goodwife, hout said John, it’s no meikle faut,
but I dinna like it, they got men or they were married. And
what shall I do wi’ them said the goodman.</p>

<p>John. A deed goodman as ye’re ay dealing among dead
beasts and living beasts, I wad put them awa amang ither
beasts, or gin ye be aun ony penny, let some body tak them
up o’ desperate debt, I sud flay the sikes frae them, they
anger’d you an’ sham’d you baith wi’ their bastards, a wheen
daft jades it gets men or they be married, and bairns or they
get bridals.</p>

<p>Goodwife. A wat weel that’s true lad.</p>

<p>Girzy. A weel John than, will ye tak me, I hae nae
bastards, how will you and I do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>John. I watna gin ye be able to get a bastard, yet ye may
hae some war faut; but ye maun be my pennyworth for ye’re
unco little, and I’m o’er muckle, and gin ye and I war ance
cairded thro’ ither, we may get bonny weans o’ a midlen
mak; I hae nae fauts to ye, but ye hae a high breast, a hump
back, a short neck, and high shoulders, the hands and legs
may do, tho’ your mouth be a wee bit to the tae side it will
ly well to the rock and I hae a hantle o’ tow to spin, will be
baith sarks and sacks till us, ye’ll be my sonsy dauty up and
down; a perfect beauty, wi’ cats yellow een, black brows and
red lips, and your very nose is a purpey colour, ye hae nae
fauts at a’: now whan will we be married.</p>

<p>Girzy. Ha, ha, John lad, we maun think on that yet.</p>

<p>John. What the yeltow lass, shoudna ye be ready whan
I’m ready, and every body says that the women’s aye ready.</p>

<p>Goodman. Ye’ll hae to come back and bring somebody
wi’ you, and we’ll gree about it, and set the day whan ye’ll be
married.</p>

<p>John. A well goodman I’ll tell my mither o’t, and come
back on munonday, and we’ll hae a chappin o’ ale and roasted
cheese on the gude chance o’t, but I maun hae a word o’ the
bride outby to convoy me, an a quiet speak to hersel about it.</p>

<p>Good wife. A wow na John, the daft louns will laugh at
you, and she’ll think shame, gang ye out by and she’ll speak
to you thro’ the gavel window.</p>

<p>Out goes John, and the bride and her twa sisters goes to
the window within to hear the diversion, and what he would
say; now says John, Girzy my dear, my braw pretty woman,
an ye be in earnest tell me, for by my suthe I’m no scorning.</p>

<p>Girzy. Indeed John I’m very willing to tak you, but ye
need na tell every body about it.</p>

<p>John. Then gi’ me a kiss on that? He shutes his head in
at the window, making a lang neck to win down to her, and
she stood on a little stool to win up to him, O cries he, an
ye were good flesh I could eat you a’ I like you sae well, it’s a
pity there is sic a hard wa’ a ’tween us, I’se tell my mither sae
bonny as ye’re: O gi’ me anither kiss yet an then I’ll go;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
one of her sisters standing by in a dark corner, get’s ha’d of a
cow’s head which wanted a’ the skin but about the mouth,
and shutes it towards his mouth, which he kiss’d in the dark,
O cry’d he, but your mouth be cauld since I kiss’d ye last, and
I think ye hae a beard, I saw nae that afore, or is’t wi’ spinning
tow that maks your mouth sae rough at e’en?</p>

<p>Hame he comes, and tells his mither the speed and properties
of the marriage; a’ things was got ready, and next week
sleeky Willy the weaver and him came to gree the marriage
and stay a’ night wi’ the bride, and teach John gude manners,
for whan John was hungry he minded his meat more than his
gude behaviour, and as he never was fu’ till the dish was tume,
Willy the weaver was to tramp on his fit when he thought he
had supped enough; so all things being agreed upon short
and easy terms and the wedding day sett, they were to be
three times cry’d on Sunday and quietly married on Munonday,
neither piper nor fidler to be employ’d, but sweith awa’ hame
frae the minister, and into the bed amang the blankets, ha,
ha, cries John, that’s the best o’t a’.</p>

<p>Now every thing being concluded and proposed, the supper
was brought, a large fat haggies, the very smell would done
a hungry body gude, but John had only got twa or three soups
until are of the butcher’s meikle dogs tramped on John’s fit,
which he took to be the weaver, and then he would sip no more;
after supper they went to bed, John and the weaver lay together,
and then he abused the weaver for tramping sae soon
which he denied; but O, said John, there’s a hantle o’t left,
and I saw where it was set, they’re a’ sleeping, I’ll go rise and
tak a soup o’t yet, ay een do sae said Sleeky Willy, and
bring a soup to me too; away then John goes to the amry
and lays to the haggies, till his ain haggies cou’d had nae
mair, then brings the rest to Sleeky Willy, but instead of
going to the bed whare he was, goes to the bed whare the
bride and her twa sisters lay, they being fast asleep, speaks
slowly, will ye tak it, will ye tak it, but they making no
answers, he turns up the blankets to put a soup into Willy’s
mouth, but instead of doing so, he puts a great spoonful close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
into one of their backsides, Sleeky Willy hears all that past,
comes out o’ the bed, and sups out the remainders, and sets up
the dish whare it was, leaves the amry door open to let the
cats get the blame of supping the haggies, and awa’ they goes
to bed, but poor John cou’d get nae sleep for drouth, up he
gets in search of the water can, and finding an empty pitcher,
puts in his hand to find if there was any water in it, but
finding none, he closed his hand when it was within the
pitcher, and then could not get it out, goes to the bed and
tells Sleeky Willy what had happened him, who advised him
to open the door and go out to a knocking-stane that stood
before the door, and break it there to get out his hand, and
not to mak a noise in the house, so out he goes, but the
bride’s sister who had gotten the great spoonful of the haggies
laid to her backside was out before him, rubbing the nastiness
(as she took it to be) off the tail of her sark, and she being in
a louting posture, he took her for the knocking-stane, and
comes o’er her hurdies with the pitcher, till it flew in pieces
about her, then off she runs wi’ the fright, round a turf stack
and into the house before him; John comes in trembling to
the bed again wi’ the fright, praying to preserve him, for sic
a knocking stane he never saw, for it ran clean awa’ when he
brake the pigg upon it.</p>

<p>Now John was furnished in a house by his Father-in-law, the
bed, loom, heddles, treadles, thrums, reeds and pirn-wheel
was a’ brought and set up, before the marriage, which was kept
as a profound secret; so that John got the first night of his ain
wife, and his ain house a’ at ae time: So on the next morning
after the marriage, John and his wife made up some articles,
how they were to work, and keep house, John was to keep
the house in meat, meal, fire, and water; Girzy was to mak
the meat and keep the house in clothes, the Father-in-law to
pay their rent for three years, they were to hae no servants,
until they had children, and the first child was to be a John
after its ain Daddy, get it wha will, if a boy, and if a girl,
Girzy after its ain Minny, as he said, wha had wrought best for’t.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>I. Then she ordered John to rise and begin his work, by
putting on a fire, and take the twa new piggs and gang to the
well, no sooner had John opened the door, and gone out with
a pigg in every hand, than a’ the boys and girls being
gathered in a croud to see him, gave a loud huzza, and clapping
their hands at him, poor John not knowing what it
meant, thought it was fine sport, began to clap his hands too,
and not minding the two piggs, clashes the tane against the
tither, till baith went in pieces, and that was a chearful huzza,
to baith young and auld that was looking at him. Girzel the
wife draws him into the house, and to him she flies with the
wicked wife’s wapons, her Tongue and Tangs, made his ribbs
to crack, saying, They tell’d me ye was daft, but I’ll ding the
daffing out o’ ye, I’ll begin wi’ ye as I’m amind to end wi’
ye; poor John sat crying and clawing his lugs. Ha, ha, said
he, its nae bairns play to be married, I find that already;
his Mither-in-law came in and made up peace, went to a
cooper, and got them a big wooden stoup to carry in their
water.</p>

<p>II. Next morning John was sent to the flesh-market an
errand to his Father-in-law, who gave him a piece of flesh to
carry home, and as he was coming out of the market, he saw
six or seven of the fleshers-dogs fall on and worry at a poor
country colley dog, Justice, justice, cries John to the dogs,
ye’re but a wheen unmannerly raskel’s, that fa’s a on ae poor
beast, heth ye sude a’ be put in the toubooth, and tane to the
bailies, and hang’d for the like o’ that, it’s perfect murder, and
in he runs amongst the dogs, and be hang’d to you a’ the-gither,
What is the quarrel? What is the quarrel? John
flings down the flesh he had carrying, and grips the colley,
who took John for an enemy too, and bites his hands, till the
blood followed, the whole of the tykes comes on a poor John,
till down he goes in the dirt amongst their feet, and one of
the dogs runs off with his flesh, so John went hame both dirty
and bloody without his flesh, tell’d Girzy how it happened,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
who applied her old plaister, her tangs and tongue, made
John to curse the very minister that married them, and wished
he might never do a better turn.</p>

<p>III. Next morning, John was sent to the well with the
great stoup to bring in water for breakfast, and as he was
pulling the stoup out of the well, in he tumbles, and his head
down, the well being narrow, he you’d na win out, some people
passing, by chance heard the slunge, cried, and runs to his
relief, hail’d him out half dead, and helped him into the house,
and after getting a dry sark, he was comforted with the old
plaister, her tongue and the hard tangs.</p>

<p>IV. Next day, she says, John, I must go to the market
myself, for if you go, you’ll fight wi’ the dogs, and let them
run awa’ wi’ ony thing ye buy, see that ye put on the pot, and
hae’t boiling again I come hame; John promised well, but
performs very badly, she’s no sooner gone, than he puts on
the new pot without any water in it, and a good fire to make
it boil, and away he goes to the unhappy well, fills his stoup
and sets it down, to look at a parcel of boys playing at Cat
and Dog, they perswades John to take a game wi’ them, on he
plays till are o’ the boys cries, hy John, yonder’s your Girzy
coming. John runs into the house wi’ the water, and the pot
being red hot on the fire, he tumes in the cold water into it,
which made the pot flee all in pieces, just as she was entering
the door. John runs for it, and she runs after him, crying,
haud the thief, some persons stop’d him, she comes up, and
then she laboured him all the way home, and he crying, O sirs,
ye see what it is to be married; the Mither-in-law had to
make up a peace again, and he promised good behaviour in
time to come.</p>

<p>V. On the next morning she sent him to the water to wash
some cows puddings, and turn them on a spindle, showing
him how he was to do or he went away; John goes to the
water very willingly, and as he turn’d and wash’d them, he
laid them down behind him, where one of his Father-in-law’s
big dogs stood, and ate them up as fast as he laid them down
till all was gone but the very last one, which he carried home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
in his hand, crying like a child, and underwent a severe tost
of the old plaister, before any mercy was shown.</p>

<p>VI. His Father-in-law next day sent him away to bring
home a fat calf he had bought in the country, and tied up the
money in a napkin, which he carried in his hand for fear he
should lose it, being very weighty as it was all in halfpence,
and as he was going alongst a bridge, he meets a man running
after a horse, who cries to John to stop the horse, John meets
him on the top of the bridge, and when he wou’d not be
stopped for him, he knocks the horse on the face wi’ the napkin
and the money, so the napkin broke and most of the half-pence
flew over the bridge in the water, which made poor
John go home crying very bitterly for his loss, and dread of
the auld plaister which he got very sickerly.</p>

<p>VII. On the next morning, she sent him again to the
bridge to see if he you’d find any of it in the water, and there
he found some ducks sweeming, and ducking down with their
heads below the water, as he thought gathering up his money
he kills one of them and rips her up, but found none of it in
her guts or gabbie, then says he, they have been but looking
for it, I’ll go do as they did, strips off his clothes and leaves
them on the bridge, goes in a ducking, in which time a rag
man came past and took away all his clothes, so he went
home naked to get a bath of the old plaister.</p>

<p>VIII. The next morning she sent him to a farm house for
a piggful of butter milk, and as he was returning through the
fields the farmer’s bull and anither bull was fighting, the farmer’s
bull being like to lose, John runs in behind him and
sets his head to the bull’s tail, in purpose to help him to push
against the other, but the poor bull thought John was some
other bull attacking him behind, fled aside, and the other bull
came full-drive upon John, pushed him down, broke the pigg
and spilt the milk, so John went home to his auld plaister,
which began to be an usual diet to him, and so he regarded it
the less.</p>

<p>IX. His Mother-in-law with several auld witty wives held
a private counsel on John’s conduct and bad luck, and con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>cluded
he was bewitched, John was of the same opinion, and
went to the minister, and told him he was the cause of a’ his
misfortunes, ca’d him a warlock to his face, and said, he had
put such a black bargain in his hand, that he was ruin’d for
ever; insisted either to unmarry them again, or send death
and the bell-man to take her awa’, for she has a lump of
mischief on her back and anither on her breast, and the rest
of her body is a clean deil. The minister began to exhort
him to peace and patience, telling him that marriage was
made in heaven: ye’re a baist liar, says John, for I was married
in your ain kitchen, an a’ the blackguards about the
town was there, an it had a-been heaven they wadna win in,
yet tell’t me that matrimony was sic a happy state, but an ye
had gotten as mony we’ll paid skins as I hae gotten, ye wad
ken what it is; ill chance on you stir, and out he goes, cursing
like a madman, throwing stanes, and breaking the minister’s
windows, for which he was catch’d and put twa hours i’ the
stocks, and at last his Lump of Corruption came and rubbed
his lugs, threw his nose, got him out, and drove him home
before her; took a resolution never to set him about any
bisiness in time coming, but keep him on his loom.</p>

<p>X. Now she giving him no sleep a’ that night for scolding;
John got up in the morning lang or day, leaving his tormentor
in bed; fell asleep upon his loom with his candle in his hand,
and so set the web, heddles, reed, and treadle cords in a fire,
by chance his old Viper looked out of the bed, or the whole
house had been gone; up she got, and with her cries alarm’d
the neighbourhood who came to her relief, but poor John
underwent a dreadful swabing for this.</p>

<p>XI. After the former hurry and beating being over, his
work being stopt, he went to bed and sleept a’ that day, and
following night, on the next day having nothing to do; she
sent him in search of a hen’s-nest, who had taken some by-place
to lay her eggs in, so as poor John was in an auld kill
searching a’ about the walls, the kill-ribs brake, and down he
goes with a vengeance into the logie cutted and bruised himself
in a terrible manner, up he could not win, but had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
creep out at the logie below, scarcely able to get hame, his face
and nose a’ running o’ blood, in this condition she pitied and
lamented for him very much, tied his sores and laid him in
bed, then sat down very kindly, saying, My dear and my
lamb, do ye think there is ony o’ your banes broken, and what
part o’ you is sairest? And what will I get to do you good?
O! said he Girzy I’m a brizel’d atween the feet; Are ye indeed
quoth she, then I wish ye had broken your neck, that I might
a gotten anither, useless ae way, and useless mae ways, a po’
my word, ye’s no be here, gang whar ye like.</p>

<p>XII. Now, as poor John was turn’d out o’ doors next morning,
to go awa’ hirpling on a staff, one came and told him his
Mother had died last night, Oh hoch, said John, and is my
Mither clean dead; O an she wad but look down thro’ the lift,
and see how I’m guided this morning, I’m sure she wad send
death for me too: I’m out o’ a mither, and out o’ a wife, out o’
my health and strength and a’ my warklooms. His mother-in-law
came and pleaded for him: haud your tongue, mither, said
Girzy, if ye kend what ail’d him, ye wadna speak about him,
he’s useless, no worth the keeping in a house, but to ca’ him to
die like an auld beast at a dyke-side, hout tout, co’ the auld wife,
we’ll mak o’ him and he’ll mend again: so John got peace
made up after a’, and he was easier mended than the burnt
web; got all his treadles and warklooms set in order the
wife’s tongue excepted, which was made of wormwood, and
the rest of her body of sea-water, which is always in a continual
tempest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So John appeals to a Jedburgh jury, if it be not easier to
deal wi’ fools, than headstrong fashous fouks; owns he has but
an empty scull, but his wicked wife wants wit to pour judgment
into it, never tells him o’ danger till it come upon him,
for his mother said, he was a bidable bairn, if ony body had
been to learn him wit.</p>

<p>[This is one of the most valuable folk-lore chap-books ever issued from the press.
Its richness in this respect has attracted the attention of Professor Stephens of
Copenhagen, who gave some quotations from it in the second volume of <cite>The Folk-Lore
Record</cite>. The edition used here is from the library of Alexander Macdonald,
Esq., and bears the following on the title-page:&mdash;‘The Ancient and Modern
History of Buck-haven in Fife-shire. Wherein is contained, The Antiquities of their
old Dress. The Bucky-boat, with a flag of a green tree; with their dancing,
Willy and his trusty rapper. Their Burgess Ticket, with a view of their new
College: the noted sayings and exploits of Wise Willy in the Brae, Witty Eppie
the ale-wife, and Lingle-tail’d Nancy. By Merry Andrew at Tamtallon. Glasgow,
Printed by J. and M. Robertson, Saltmarket, 1806.’ It is a 24 pp. 12mo,
and is illustrated by several rough woodcuts which had apparently done service in
other chap-books. The editor has carefully collated it with the following
editions:&mdash;One, undated, by Morren, Cowgate, Edinburgh; another, also without
date, by Morren, but a different issue from the other, there being a change in
the illustrations; one published in 1817 by R. Hutchison &amp; Co., 10 Saltmarket,
Glasgow; and an abridged one by M. Randall, Stirling (without date), with this
short title&mdash;‘The Exploits of Wise Willie, and Witty Eppie the Ale-Wife of
Buchaven.’ The three editions last mentioned, were courteously sent to the editor,
all the way from Copenhagen, by Professor Stephens. There is also a modern
Glasgow edition, greatly abridged, the text, as issued by Randall, having evidently
been used by its publishers.]</p></div>

<div class="chapter" id="amh-I">
<p class="p2 center">THE HISTORY OF BUCK-HAVEN.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Amongst several ancient records, this Bucky is not mentioned;
there was a set called Buccaniers, who were pirates, that is to
say sea-robbers, and after a strict search for that set of sea-robbers,
they dispersed; what of them escaped justice in the
southern climate, are said to have sheltered at or near Berwick
upon Tweed. After a smart battle, among themselves, they
divided, and ’tis said, the party who gained this Bucky-battle,
fearing the English law to take place, set northward and took
up their residence at this Buck-haven, so called not only from
the great quantity of Buckies that are found in and about that
place, but on account of the battle they had with their neighbours
at Berwick when they divided, which was then called
bucking one another, but is now named boxing or fighting.
Another party of these Buckers settled in another town northward
of Banff, called Bucky, near the river Spey, which is a
large sea-town, but among all the sea-towns in Scotland, the
fishers still retain a language, quite different from the people
in the country, and they almost all shift the letter H, and use
O, instead thereof which no country-people do in Scotland,
but themselves.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> There is a corruption of speech, in every
county over all Britain, and likewise they use different tones
and pronouncing words from others, even some in the South of
Scotland, can hardly be understood by those in the North,
though both pretend to speak English, and have a liberal part
of education: but since learning is now so easy to be obtained,
ignorance and corruption of speech are greatly decreased.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In the county of Fife, on the sea-coast, there stands a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
town, inhabited by few but fishers, called Bucky-harbour, because
of the sea buckies and shells to be found so plenty on the
rocks, in and about that place; there is little mention made of
this town by historians, to know its original extraction and
antiquities, but in their own burges-ticket, which was part of
it perfect truths, but more of it by way of lampoon; this
ticket was dated the two and thirty day of the month of Julius
Cæsar, their coat of arms was two hands gripping each other
over a Scate’s rumple, their oath was, “I wish the de’il may
tak me an I binna an honest man to you, an ye binna de like
to me.” An article of good neighbourhood they had, whoever
was first up in a good morning, was to raise all the rest to go
to sea, but if a bad morning, they piss and lie down again till
break of day then raise Wise Willy, who could judge of the
weather by the blowing of the wind.</p>

<p>Their freedoms were to take all sorts of fish contained in
their tickets, viz., lobsters, partans, podles, spout-fish, sea-cats,
sea-dogs, flukes, pikes, dike-padocks, and p&mdash; fish.</p>

<p>Among these people were said to be one Tom and his two
sons, who were fishers on the coast of Norway, and in a violent
storm were blown over, and got ashore at Bucky-harbour,
where they settled, and the whole of his children were called
Thomsons,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> this is a historical saying, handed down from one
generation to another. So in course of time they grew up and
multiplied, that they soon became a little town by themselves;
few of any other name dwelt among them, and were all called
the Thomsons; they kept but little communication with the
country people, for a farmer in those days thought his daughter
cast awa, if she married one of the fishers of Bucky-harbour,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
and Witty Eppie the ale-wife, wad a sworn be-go laddie, I
wad rather see my boat and a’ my three sons dadet against
the Bass or I saw ony ane o’ them married on a muck-a-byre’s
daughter, a wheen useless taupies, that can do naething but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
rive at a tow-rock, and cut corn; they can neither bait a hook
nor red a line, hook sandles nor gather periwinkles.</p>

<p>Now Wise Willy and Witty Eppie the ale-wife lived there,
about an hundred years ago. Eppie’s chamber was their
college and court-house, where they decided their controversies,
and explained their wonders, for the house was wide like a
little kirk, had four windows and a gavel-door, the wives got
leave to flyte their fill, but fighting was forbidden, (as Eppie
said, up hands was fair play) their fines, were a’ in pints o’ ale,
and Eppie sold it at a plack the pint; they had neither minister
nor magistrate, nor yet a burly-bailie to brag them wi’ his
tolbooth; my Lord was their landlord,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Wise Willy and Witty
Eppie the ale-wife were the rulers of the town.</p>

<p>Now Eppie had a daughter, call’d Lingle-tail’d Nancy, because
of her feckless growth, her waist was like a twitter, had
nae curpen for a creel, being Embruch bred, and brought up
wi’ her Lowdin aunty, was learned to read and sew, make
corse-claiths and callico-mutches,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> there wasna scholar in the
town but hersel, she read the Bible and the book of Kirk-sangs
which was newly come in fashion, Willy and Eppie
tell’d ay what it meant, and said a’ the letters in it, was litted
by my Lord, for they saw him hae a feather that he dipped
in black water, and made crooked scores just like the same, and
then he spoke to it o’er again, and it tell’d him what to say.</p>

<p>It happened on a day, that two of their wives found a horse-shoe
near the town, brought it hame, and sent for Wise Willy to
see what it was. Willy comes and looks at it, Indeed co’ Willy,
its a thing and holes in’t. Then said they, he would get a name
til’t, aha, co’ Willy, but whair did ye find it? aneath my
Lords ain house, Willy. Adeed, said Willy, its the auld moon,
I ken by the holes in’t for nailing it to the lift; but I wonder
it she fell in Fife, for the last time I saw her she was hinging on
her back aboon Embruch, a hech co’ Willy we’ll hae her set up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
the highest house in the town, and we’ll hae moon-light o’ our
ain a’ the days o’ the year. The whole town ran to see the
moon; hout tout, cried Witty Eppie, ye’re a’ fools together,
it is but ane o’ the things it my Lord’s mare wears upo’ her
lufe.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>At another time, one of the wives found a hare with its legs
broken, lying among her kail in the yard; she, not knowing
what it was, called out her neighbours to see it, some said it
was a gentleman’s cat, or my lady’s lap-dog, or a sheep’s
young kitlen, because it had saft horns; Na, na, cry’d Wise
Willy, its ane o’ the maukens, that gentlemen’s dogs worrie.
What will you do wi’t? haith co’ Maggy, I’ll singe the woo’
afi’t, and mak fish and sauce o’t to my Tammy’s parrich: No,
no, said Witty Eppie, better gie’t to my Lord, and he’d stap
an iron stick thro’ the guts o’t, and gar’t rin round afore the
fire till it be roasted; Na, na, said Wise Willy, we’ll no do that
indeed, for my Lord wad mak us a’ dogs, an gar us rin thro’
the kintry seeking maukins till him.</p>

<p>It happened on a dark winter morning, that two of the
wives were going to Dysart to sell their fish, and near the road-side
there happened to be a tinker’s ass tedder’d, and the poor
ass seeing the wives coming with their creels, thought it was
the tinkers coming to flit or remove him, fell a crying, the two
wives threw their fish away, and ran home like mad persons,
crying, they had seen the de’il, aye the very horned de’il, an
that he had spoken to them, and cried after them, but they
did not ken what he said, for it was worse words than a Highlandman’s.
The whole town was in an uproar, some would go
with picks and spades and hag him a’ in pieces, others wad
gang and catch him in a strong net, and then they could either
hang or drown him. Na, na, co’ Wise Willy, we manna cast
out wi’ him at the first, as he’s gotten the twa burden o’ fish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
he’ll ables gang his wa’ and no fash nae mair, he is o’er souple
to be catch’d in a net, a’ your pith ’ill neither hang him nor
drown him, an’ the kintry he comes frae is a’ het coals, he’ll
never burn, we’ll go to him in a civil manner, and see what he
wants: get out Eppie the ale-wife, and lingle-tail’d Nancy,
with the Bible and the Saum-book:<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> so aff they came in a
croud, either to kill the de’il or catch him alive, and as they
came near the place, the ass fell a crying, which caused many
of them to faint and run back: Na, na, co’ Willy, that’s no the
de’ils words ava’, it’s my Lord’s trumpeter touting on his brass
whistle, Willy ventured till he saw the ass’s twa lugs, now,
cried Willy back to the rest, come forward and hand him fast,
I see his twa horns, hech sirs, he has a white beard like an auld
beggar man, so they enclosed the poor ass on all sides thinking
it was the de’il: but when Wise Willy saw he had nae
cloven feet, he cried out, Fearna’ lads, this is no the de’il, it’s
some living beast, ’tis neither a cow nor a horse, and what is it
then Willy? Indeed co’ Willie, ’tis the father o’ a’ the maukens,
I ken by its lugs.</p>

<p>Now some say, this is too satirical a history, but it is according
to the knowledge of those times, not to say in any place
by another, old wives tell us yet of many such stories, as the
devil appearing to their grandfathers and grandmothers, and
dead wives coming back again to visit their families, long after
their being buried: but this Bucky-haven which was once noted
for droll exploits, is now become more knowing, and is a place
said to produce the best and hardiest watermen or sailors of
any town on the Scots coast, yet many of the old people in it,
still retain the old tincture of their old and uncultivated speech,
as be-go-laddie, also a fiery nature, if you ask any of the wives
where their college stands, they’ll tell you, if your nose were
in their arse, your mouth would be at the door of it.</p>

<p>Now, it happened, when Wise Willy turned old he took a
great swelling in his wame, and casting up o’ his kail, collops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and cauld fish, that nothing staid on his stomach, and a stout
stomach had he, for crab-heads, or scate-brose, or fat-brose on a
bridal morning; yet it fail’d him; he fell sick, and none could
cure him, or tell what ail’d him, till a mountebank stage-doctor
came to Kirkcaldy, that could judge by people’s water, the
troubles of their person, and Willy hearing of his fame, pissed
into a bottle, and sent it away with his daughter; the bottle
being uncorked, his daughter spilt it by the way, and to conceal
her sloth in so doing, pissed in it herself, and on she goes, till she
comes to the stage, and cries, Sir Dochter, Sir Dochter, here is a
bottle o’ my father’s wash, he has a sair guts, and never needs
to drite ony, he spues a’ he eats, ’tis true I tell you my dow;
the doctor looks at it, and says, It is not your father’s, surely
it is your mother’s; de’il’s i’ the man, co’ she, divna I ken my
father by my mother? Then, said he, he is with child: A
de’il’s i’ the man co’ she, for my mother bore a’ de bairns before,
dat’s no true sir, a figs ye’re a great liar, home she came,
and tell’d Willy her father, that the doctor said he was wi’
bairn. O waes me, co’ Willy, for I hae a muckle wame, and
I fear its o’er true, O plague on you Janet, for ye’re the father
o’t, and I’m sure to die in the bearing o’t. Witty Eppie was
sent for, as she was houdy, and fand a’ Willy’s wame, to be
sure about it, indeed co’ Eppie ye’re the first man e’er I saw
wi’ bairn before; and how ye’ll bear’t I dinna ken, ye hae a
wally wame, weel I wat, but how men bear bairns I never saw
them yet, but I would drink sa’t water and drown’t in my
guts, for an men get anes the gate o’ bearing weans themsells,
they’ll seek nae mae wives: so Willy drank sea-water till his
guts was like to rive, and out he goes to ease himself among
the kail, and with the terrible hurl of farting, up starts a
mauken behind him, thinking she was shot, Willy sees her
jumping o’er the dike, thought it was a child brought forth,
cries, Come back my dear and be christened, and no rin to the
hills and be a Pagan,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> so Willy grew better every day thereafter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
being brought to bed in the kail-yard: but his daughter
was brought to bed some months thereafter, which was the
cause of the doctor’s mistake.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<div class="chapter" id="amh-II">
<h3 class="lsp2">PART II.</h3>
</div>

<p>Now Wise Willie had a daughter, called Rolloching Jenny,
because she spoke thick, sax words at three times, half sense
and half nonsense, as her own words and actions will bear witness.
She being with child, was brought to bed of a bonnie
lass bairn: and a’ the wives in the town, cried, Be-go-laddie,
its just like its ain daddy, lang Sandy Tason (or Thomson)
we ken by its nose: for Sandy had a great muckle red nose
like a lobster-tae, bowed at the point like a hawk’s neb, and
Sandy himself said, that it was surely his or some ither body’s,
but he had used a’ his birr at the getting o’t, to fey his ability,
being the first time e’er he was at sic a business before,
and when he had done a’ that man could do at it, said, it was
nonsense and shamefa’ him, but he wad rather row his boat
round the Bass and back again, or he did the like again: For
Wise Willy gade wood at the wean, and said, it had mair ill
nature in’t, than the auldest wife about the town, it piss’d the
bed, and shute the bed, skirl’d like a wil-cat, and kept him frae
his night’s rest; and a’ the auld haggs about the town, ca’d
him Sandy de bairn’s daddy, and a’ the young gilly-gawkie
lasses, held out their fingers, and cried, Tie, hie, Sandy, the
kirk will kittle your hips for yon yet.</p>

<p>And after a’, the blear-ein’d bell-man came bladdering
about the buttock-mail, summoned him and her before the
hally-band, a court that held in the kirk on Saturday
morning; and a’ the bred ladies<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> round about, cried, Ay, ay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Sandy, pay the bill-siller, or we’ll cut the cow’s tail awa’, so
poor Sandy suffered sadly in the flesh, besides the penalty
and kirk-penance.</p>

<p>But Wise Willy had pity upon them, and gade wi’ them to
the kirk-court, what learned folks call the session, Jenny was
first called upon, and in she goes where all the hally-band were
conveened, elders and youngers, deacons, and dog-payers
keeping the door, the cankerdest Carles that could be gotten
between Dysart and Dubby-side, white heads and bald heads
sitting wanting bonnets, wi’ their white headed staves and
hodden-grey jockey-coats about them.</p>

<p>Mess John says, Come away Janet, we’re a’ waiting on you
here.</p>

<p>Min. Now Janet, where was this child gotten? you must
tell plainly.</p>

<p>Jan. A deed stir, it was gotten amang the black stanes, at
the cheek of the crab-holes.</p>

<p>Mess John stares at her, not knowing the place but some
of the elders did; then said he, O Janet, but the de’il was busy
with you at that time.</p>

<p>Jan. A by my fegs stir, that’s a great lie ye’re telling now,
for the de’il wasna thereabout, it I saw, nor nae body else, to
bid us do either ae thing or anither, we loo’d ither unco’ weel for
a lang time before that, and syne we tell’d ither, and agreed to
marry ither like ither honest fouk, than mightna we learn to do
the thing married fouk does, without the de’il helping us.</p>

<p>Whisht, whisht, cried they, you should be scurged, fause
loon quean it thou is, ye’re speaking nonsense.</p>

<p>Jan. The deil’s i’ the carles, for you and your minister is
liars, when ye say it de de’il was helping Sandy and me to get
the bairn.</p>

<p>Come, come, say they, pay down the kirk-dues, and come
back to the stool the morn, four pound, and a groat to the
bell-man.</p>

<p>Jan. The auld thief speed the dearth o’t stir, for less might
sair you and your bell-man baith, O but this be a hard warld
indeed, when poor honest fouk maun pay for making use o’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
their ain a&mdash;, ye misca’ ay the poor de’il a-hint his back, and gie
him the wyte o’ a’ de ill it’s done in the kintry, bastard barns
and every thing, and if it be sae as ye say, ye may thank de
de’il for that gude four pund and de groat I hae gi’en you,
that gars your pots boil brown, and get jockey-coats, and
purl-handed sarks and white-headed staves, when my father’s
pot wallops up rough bear and blue water.</p>

<p>The woman’s mad, said they, for this money is a’ given to
the poor of the parish.</p>

<p>Jan. The poor of the parish, said she, and that’s the way
o’t, a fint hate ye gie them but wee pickles o’ pease-meal,
didna I see’t in their pocks, and the minister’s wife gie’s
naething ava to unco beggars, but bids them gang hame to
their ain parish, and yet ye’ll tak de purse frae poor fouks, for
naething but playing the loun awee or they be married, and
syne cocks them up to be looked on and laught at by every
body, a de’il speed you and your justice stir; hute, tute, ye are
a coming on me like a wheen colly dogs, hunting awa’ a poor
ragget chapman frae the door, and out she comes cursing and
greeting: Sandy’s next called upon, and in he goes.</p>

<p>Min. Now Saunders, you maun tell us how this child was
gotten?</p>

<p>San. A wow, Mess John stir, you hae bairns o’ your ain,
how did you get them? but yours is a’ laddies, and mine is
but a lassie, if you’ll tell me how ye got your laddie, I’ll tell
you how I got my lassie, and then we’ll be baith alike good o’
the business.</p>

<p>The minister looks at him, hute, tute, Saunders, lay down
four pund and a groat, and come back to-morrow to the stool,
and give satisfaction to the congregation, you had more need
to be seeking repentance for that abominable sin of uncleanness,
than speaking so to me.</p>

<p>San. Then there is your siller stir, I hae gotten but poor
penny-worths for’t, and ye’ll tell me to repent for’t, what the
auld thief needs I repent, when I’m gaun to marry de woman,
and then I’ll hae to do’t o’er again every day, or they’ll be nae
peace in the house; figs it’s nonsense to pay siller, repent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
do’t again too, a fine advice indeed master minister, and that
is how ye live.</p>

<p>Wise Willy. Now stir, you and master elders, ye manna
put them on the black creepy till they be married; they
suffered enough at ae time.</p>

<p>A well, a well, said they, but they must marry very soon then.</p>

<p>I trow sae says Sandy, ye’ll be wanting mair siller, fule
hate ye’ll do for naething here.</p>

<p>Hame came Sandy, starving o’ hunger, ye might a casten a
knot on his lang guts, his mither was baking pease bannocks,
up he gets a lump of her leaven into his mouth, auld thief be
in your haggies-bag, Sandy, kirk-fouks is ay greedy, ye been
wi’ the minister the day, ye’d get a good lang grace, he might
a gi’en you meat thou filthy dog that tu is, thou hast the bulk
of a little whalpie o’ my leaven in your guts, it wada been
four good bannocks and a scone, and a sair’d our Sunday’s
dinner, sae wad it een, but an ye keep a reeking house and a
rocking cradle three eleven years as I hae done, less o’ that
will sair ye yet, baggity beast it tu is, mair it I bore thee
now, a hear ye that my dow.</p>

<p>The next exploit was an action at law, against the goodman
of Muir-edge, a farmer who lived near by, that kept sheep and
swine, his sheep came down and broke into their yards and
ate up their kail; the wild hares, they thought, belonged to
the same man, as they ran towards his house when they were
hunted; the swine came very often in and about their houses,
seeking fish guts and ony thing they cou’d get, so it happened
that one of their children, sitting easing itself, one of the swine
tumbles it over, and bites a piece out of the child’s backside:
The whole town rose in an uproar, and after Grunkie, as they
called her, they catched her and took her before Wise Willy:
Willy takes an ax and cuts two or three inches off her long
nose, now says Willy, I trow I have made thee something
Christian-like, thou had sic a long mouth and nose before, it
wad a frighted a very de’il to look at ye; but now your fac’d
like a little horse or cow: the poor sow ran home roaring all
blood and wanting the nose, which caused Muir-edge to warn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
them in before my Lord: so the wives that had their kail
eaten, appeared first in the court, complaining against Muir-edge.
Indeed, my Lord, Muir-edge is no a good man, when
he’s sick an ill neighbour, he keeps black hares and white
hares, little wee brown backed hares wi’ white arses, and loose
wagging horns, de muckle anes loups o’er the dyke and eats
a de kail, and de little anes wi’ de wagging horns, creeps in
at our water gush-holes, and does the like, when we cry pisue,
they ran awa’ hame to Muir-edge, but I’ll gar my colly hand
’em by the fit, and I’ll hand ’em by the horn, an pu’ a’ de hair
aff ’em, and send ’em hame wanting the skin, as he did wi’
Sowen Tammy’s wi’ Sandy, for codding o’ his pease, he took
aff de poor laddies coat, a sae did he e’en.</p>

<p>A well then, said my Lord, what do you say, but call in
Wise Willy.</p>

<p>In he comes, A well my Lord, I shall suppose an ye were a
sow, and me sitting d&mdash;&mdash;g, and you to bite my arse, sudna I
tak amends o’ you for that? Od my Lord, ye wadna hae sic
a bit out o’ your arse for twenty merks, ye maun just gar Muir-edge
gie ten merks to buy a plaister to heal the poor bit
wean’s arse again. Well said, Willy, says my Lord, but who
puts on the sow’s nose again? A figs my lord, said Willy,
she’s honester-like wanting it, and she’ll bite nae mair arses
wi’t, and gin ye had hane a nose, my Lord, as lang as the sow
had, ye’d been obliged to ony body it wad cut a piece aft.</p>

<p>A gentleman coming past near their town, asked one of
their wives where their college stood, said she, Give me a
shilling, and I’ll let you see both sides o’t, he gives her a
shilling, thinking to see some curious sight, now there’s one
side of your shilling and there’s the other, and ’tis mine now.</p>

</div>

<p>Now Wise Willy was so admired for his just judgement in
cutting off the sow’s nose, that my Lord in a mocking manner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
made him burly-bailie<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> of Bucky-hine. Lang Sandy was
provost, and John Thrums, the weaver, was dean of guild, but
Witty Eppie had ay the casting vote in a’ their courts and
controverses.</p>

<p>There happened one day a running horse to stand at one of
their doors, and a child going about, the horse trampled on the
child’s foot, which caused the poor child to cry, the mother
came running in a passion; crying, A wae be to you for a
’orse it ere ye was born o’ a woman, filthy barbarian bruit it
t’ou is, setting your muckle iron lufe on my bairn’s wee fittie,
od stir, I’ll drive the hair out o’ your head, gripping the horse
by the mane and the twa lugs, cuffing his chafts as if he had
been her fellow creature, crying, Be-go-laddie, I’ll gar you as
good, I’ll tak you before Wise Willy the bailie, and he will cut
aff wi’ de iron lufe, and dan you will be cripple, and gang
thro’ the kintry on a barrow, or on twa shule-staffs<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> like Rab
the Randy, an a meal-pock about your neck; Her neighbour
wife hearing and seeing what past, cried, A ye fool taupy,
what gars you say that a ’orse was born o’ a woman, do you
think dat a ’orse has a fadder or a midder like you or me, or
ony ither body about; a what way do they come to the world
dan? A ye fool taupy, divna they whalp like the louses, ae
auld ’orse hobbles on anither anes back, and dat whalps a
young ’orse: Gosh woman, it wad be ill-far’d to see a woman
sitting wi’ a young ’orse on her knee, dighting its arse, and
gien it de pap.</p>

<p>The next occasion was Lang Sandy, and Rolloching Jenny’s
wedding; which held three days and twa nights, my Lord and
my Lady, with several gentlemen and ladies, attended for
diversion’s sake,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> the piper of Kirkcaldy and the fidler of Kinghorn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
were both bidden by Wise Willy the bride’s father, and
if ony mae came to play unbidden, Wise Willy swore they
should sit unsair’d, for these twa should get a’ the siller that
was to be gien or won that day, the dinner and dorder-meat
sat a’ in Eppie’s college, and the dancing stood in twa rings
before the door, and the first day with dunting and dangling
of their heels, dang doun the sea-dyke, some tumbled in and
some held by the stanes, the fidler fell o’er the lugs an drouket
a’ his fiddle, the strings gade out of order, and the tripes
turned saft like pudding skins, so the bagpipe had to do for a’,
and the fidler got nought to do but sup kail, and pike banes wi
the rest o’ them.</p>

<p>Now my Lord’s cook was to order the kettle, but Pate o’
the Pans<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> play’d a sad prat, by casting in twa pounds of candle
among the kail, which made them fat, for some could not sup
them, for the candle wicks came ay into their cutties like
sutter’s lingles in the dish, but some wi’ stronger stomachs,
stripped them thro’ their teeth like ratton tails, an said, Mony
a ane wad be blythe o’ sic a string to tie their hose wi’ in a
pinch; my Lord and the Gentry, Mess John and the clerk
were all placed at the head of the table, opposite to the bride,
but would sup none of the candle kail. Wise Willy and the
Bridegroom served the table, and cried, Sup and a sorrow to
you, for I never liked sour kail about my house; when the
flesh came, the bride got a ram’s rumple to pick, she takes it up
and wags it at my Lord, saying, Ti hie; my Lord, what an a
piece is dat? O, said he, bride, that’s the tail-piece, it belongs
to you, Me, my Lord, it’s no mine, I never had a ting like dat,
it’s a fish tail, see as it wags, it’s a bit o’ a dead beast. O yes,
said he, bride, you hit it now; but how come you to eat with
your gloves on! Indeed my Lord, there is a reason for dat,
I hae scabbit hands. O fy, said he, I cannot believe you, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
she pulls down a piece o’ her gloves, and shows him, O yes,
said he, I see it is so; Aha, but my Lord, I wish you saw my
a&mdash;, it’s a’ in ae hatter; O fy, said he, bride, you should not
speak so before Ladies and your maiden; I wonder, said he
to Wise Willy her father, you do not teach your daughter to
speak otherwise. A be my sae, my Lord, ye may as soon
kiss her a&mdash;, as gar her speak otherwise; I find so, said my
Lord, but it lies much in lack of a teacher.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The next dish that was presented on the table, was roasted
hens, and the bride’s portion being laid upon her plate, she
says to my Lord, will ye let me dip my fowl arse, amang your
sauce? Upon my word, and that I will not, said he, if it be
as you tell’d me; hout my Lord, it’s no my arse, it’s but de
hen’s I mean; O but, said he, bride, it’s the fashion to every
one to eat off their own trencher; you may get more sauce, I
can manage all mine myself; indeed, my Lord, I thought ye
liket me better than ony body; O but, said he, I love myself
better than you, bride; Deed my Lord, I think ye’re the best
body about the house, for your Lady’s but a stinking pridefu’
jade, she thinks that we sud mak the fish a’ alike, be-go, my
Lord, she thinks we sud mak the haddies a’ like herrin, and
that we can shape them as the hens do their eggs wi’ deir arse.
O bride, said he, you, should not speak ill of my Lady; for
she hears you very well: O deed my Lord, I had nae mind o’
that, a well then, said he, drink to me, or them ye like best;
then here’s to you a’ de gither, arse o’er head. Very well said,
says my Lord, that’s good sense or something like it.</p>

<p>Dinner being over, my Lord desired the bride to dance;
Indeed, my Lord, I canna dance ony, but I’ll gar my wame
wallop foment yours, and then rin round about as fast as ye
can; very well, said he, bride, that will just do, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
neither kiss nor shake hands, but I’ll bow to you, and ye’ll
beck to me, and so we’ll have done.</p>

<p>Now, after dinner and dancing, my Lord exhorted the bride
to be a good neighbour, and to gree well, wi’ every body round
about, I wat well my Lord, ye ken I did never cast out wi’
nae body but lang Pate o’ de Pans, and he was a’ de wyte o’t,
it began wi’ a hiertieing, and a jamffing me about Sandy, de
black-stanes and de crab-holes, where de wean was gotten,
and then it turn’d to a hub-bub and colly-shangy, an or e’er
ye wad said kiss my a&mdash;, my Lord, we are aboon ither on the
mussel midden, I trow I tell’d him o’ Randy Rob his uncle,
his feif-titty it steal’d de sarks and drank de siller, an how his
midder sell’d mauky mutton, an mair nor a’ that, a sae did I
een, my Lord.</p>

<p>My Lord had a friend of his own who was a captain in the
army, who came to visit him, and hearing of the Buckers’ sayings
and exploits; was desirous to see them, and my Lord as
desirous to put them in a fright, sent his servant, and ordered
them, both men and women, to come up before his gate,
directly the morn about kail-time, and all that did not come,
was to flit and remove out of my Lord’s ground directly, this
put the whole of them in great terror, some ran to Wise Willy
to see what it mean’d, Willy said, it was before something, and
he was sure that death would be the warst o’t, come what
will; But Witty Eppie said, I ken weel what’s to come, he’s
gaun to mak de men o’ us sogers, and the wives dragoons, because
we’ve de best fighters; I ken there is something to come
on the town, for our Nancy saw Maggy’s gaist the streen, it
was bury’d four ouks syne;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> a hech co’ Willy, that’s a sign
the meal is dear i’ the ither warld, when she comes to think
on’t again; we will tak our dinner or we go, we’ll may be ne’er
come back again, so away they went lamenting all in a crowd.
My Lord and the Captain were looking out at the window to
them, the Captain cries to them, To the right about, to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
they answered, good bliss you my Lord, what does that man
say? Then said my Lord, turn your face to Maggy Millheads,
and your arse to the sea; this they did in all haste.
And what will we do now? said Willy; no more, said my
Lord, but gang away home Willy; O my bows, O my blessings
come o’er your bonny face, my Lord, I wish you may
never die, nor yet grow sick, nor naebody kill you: ye’re the
best Lord I ken on earth, for we thought a’ to be made dead
men and sogers, ye’re wiser than a’ the witches in Fife.</p>

<p>There was in Bucky-harbour, a method when they got a
hearty drink, that they went down to dance among the boats,
one, two, or three of the oldest went into a boat to see the
rest dance; when e’er they admitted a burgher there was
always a dance. One day they admitted a glied Rob Thomson,
from the island of May, an’ after he was admitted they got
account from Wise Willy that glied Rob was a witch, which
made them all stop their dancing, and Rob was cried on to
make answer to this weighty matter. Gly’d Rob cried none
of you shall stir a fit for two hours, I’se warrand you: so Rob
spang’d and jump’d over the boat several times and put them
in great terror, some cried, O ’tis i’ the air, and then they cried
they saw him i’ the air hinging, so that Rob was obliged to go
back to the May, and carry coals to the light house.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>It was reported that gly’d Rob was born in Bucky and that
his father was Willy Thomson’s son, who was banish’d for a slave
to the May,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> to carry coals; he would not tak with him, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
account he had but ae eye. After that there was no more
dancing at admitting of burgers; but the old usual way of
scate rumple, and then drink until they were almost blind.</p>

<p>Upon the Rood day,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> four young Bucky lasses were away
early in the morning with their creels full of fish, and about a
mile from the town, they saw coming down a brae like a man
driving a beast, when they came near Tardy-Tib says, ’tis a
man driving a big mauken Tib flang her creel and fish away,
the other three ran anther way, and got clear; they said it
was a horned devil. Tib told the frightsome story, and many
ran to see the poor cadger man and his ass driving the auld
mauken. The fishers look on all maukens to be devils and
witches, and if they but see the sight of a dead mauken, it
sets them a trembling.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The fisher lasses look with disdain
on a farmer’s daughter, and a’ country lasses; they call them
muck-byers and sherney-tail’d jades.</p>

<p>The Bucky lads and lasses when they go to gather bait tell
strange stories about Witches, Ghosts, Willy with the Wisp, and
the Kelpy, Fairies and Maukens, and boggles of all sorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>The Ghosts, like old horses, go all night for fear they are
seen, and be made to carry scate or fish, or be carted; and
witches are the warst kind of devils, and mak use of cats to
ride upon, or kill-kebbers, and besoms, and sail over seas in
cockle-shells, and witch lads and lasses, and disable bridegrooms.
As for Willy and the Wisp, he is a fiery devil, and
leads people off their road in order to drown them, for he
sparks sometimes at our feet, and then turns before us with his
candle, as if he were twa or three miles before us, many a good
boat has Spunkie drown’d; the boats coming to land in the
night-time, they observe a light off the land, and set in upon
it and drown.</p>

<p>The Kelpy<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> is a sly devil, he roars before a loss at sea,
and frightens both young and old upon the shore. Fairies
are terrible troublesome, they gang dancing round fouks
lums, and rin through the houses, they haunt, and play odd
tricks, and lift new born bairns from their mothers, and none of
them is safe to ly with their mothers, a night or two after
they are born, unless the mother gets a pair of men’s breeches
under her head for the first three nights; when the Fairies are
frighted, they will leave an old stock with the woman, and
whip away the child. One tried to burn an old stock that the
Fairies left in the cradle; but when the fire was put on, the
old stock jumped on upon a cat and up the lum.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Maukens
are most terrible, and have bad luck, none will go to sea that
day they see a Mauken, or if a wretched body put in a Mauken’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
fit in their creels, they need not lift them that day, as it will
be bad luck, either broken backs, or legs, or arms, or hear bad
accounts of the boats at sea.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>They are terrified for all sorts of boggles both by land and
by sea.</p>

the appearance of two horns on his head; the minister rebuked

OF GEORGE BUCHANAN.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="lsp2">PART I.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Mr. George Buchanan was a Scotsman born, and though
of mean parentage, made great progress in learning.&mdash;As for
his understanding and ready wit, he excelled all men then
alive in that age, that ever proposed questions to him.&mdash;He
was servant or teacher to King James VI. as his private
counsellor, but publicly he acted as his fool.</p>

<p>It happened one day, that a young airy noble man went into
the king’s garden to pull a flower for a young lady he fancied:
George followed at a distance; so, when the young man found
a flower to his pleasure, he would not pull it himself, but to
find it again, without further searching, he covered it with his
hat, and went away for his sweetheart: no sooner was he gone,
but up goes George, lifts his hat, and pulls the flower, then
cases himself on the spot, and covers it with the hat again,
and away he goes. In comes the young man, leading his sweetheart
to pull the flower below the hat; but as soon as he lifted
the hat, and seeing what was below, he looked like a fool. The
lady flies in a passion, off she goes, and never would countenance
him any more. The young man being sadly vexed at this affront
done to him by George, sent him a challenge to fight him, appointing
the day and place where they were to meet. Being to fight
on horseback, George gets an old stiff horse, and for harnassing,
covers him about with blown bladders, with a little small stone
in each, without either sword or spear, away to the field he
goes, where the duel was appointed; so when George saw his
enemy coming against him, all in glittering armour, armed
with sword and spear, he rode up to him with all the speed
his horse could carry him, and his horse, as is said being all
covered over with bladders, the small stones in them, made
such a terrible noise, that the gentleman’s fine gelding would
not stand the battle, but ran away, and threw his master to
the ground, which caused all the spectators to laugh, and say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the gentleman was more fool than George. The gentleman
being so enraged at this second affront, he would fight with
George on foot; but his friends persuaded him that it would
be no honour for him to fight and kill the king’s fool, and far
less to be killed by the fool, so they were advised both to
agree; but the gentleman would try another exploit with
George, for to have it said he was still the cleverest man, to
hold him a jumping-bout publicly the next day thereafter.
With all my heart, says George, and we will end in and about
where we began; they not knowing his meaning in this. The
place and hour being set where they were to meet next
morning, George in the night caused a deep pit to be made,
and the earth of it carried away, afterwards filled it up with
dung from a privy, covered it over with a green turf, so that
it might not be known by the other ground; so, according
to promise, they both met in the morning against the appointed
time: now George being the oldest man, and by them
counted the greatest fool, the young spark permitted him to
jump first, which he, according to order, performed; and jumped
within a foot of the place where the ground <ins class="corr" id="tn-242" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'was falsefied'">
was falsified</ins>: the young man seeing this, made his performance afterwards with
great airs and all his might, so that he jumped a foot over
George, but to the oxters among clean dung; whereat the
whole multitude of spectators cried out with huzzas and
laughter. Now, says George, I told you we would end in and
about where we began, and that is in clean dirt.</p>

<p>On a time after this, the king and his court was going into
the country, and they would have George to ride before them
in the fool’s dress, whereunto he seemed unwilling, but it was
the king’s pleasure. So George was mounted upon an old
horse, a pair of old riven boots, with the heels hanging down,
and a palmer coat patched over with pictures of divers kinds.
George rode before them in this posture, which caused great
laughter and diversion until they came to an inn, where they
alighted to dine; and in the time they were at dinner George
went into the stables, and with a knife cut all the horses chaffs,
not sore, but so as they might bleed. Now, as soon as dinner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
was over, and they mounted on their horses again, George
riding before them as usual, in his palmer coat and old boots,
they began to make their game of him: then George turned
about suddenly, and clapping his hands with loud laughter;
the king asked him, what made him laugh so? Laugh, says
George, how can I but laugh, when horses cannot hold their
peace? O my sovereign, says he, don’t you see how your
horses have rent their chafts laughing at my old boots; then
every man looking at his horse’s mouth, they were all in a rage
against George; the king caused him to be dismounted directly,
and charged him never to let him see his face on English
ground. Now George knowing that nothing could reconcile
the king at this time, he came away to Scotland, and caused
make him a pair of great boots and put a quantity of
Scottish earth in each of them, and away he goes for England
to see the king once more. He hearing the king and his
court were to pass through a country village, George places
himself up in an old window, and sets up his bare arse to the
king and his court as they passed by. The king was greatly
amazed to see such an unusual honour done to him, was curious
to know the performer; so he called unto him, asking him
to come down, and finding it to be George, Sir, says the king,
did not I charge you never to let me see your face again?
True, my sovereign, says George, for which cause I let you see
my arse. Ay but says the king, you was never to come on
English ground again. Neither I did, says George, pulling off
his boots before the king, saying, Behold, my Sovereign, ’tis
all Scots ground I stand upon.&mdash;The king and his court being
so diverted with this merry joke, George was admitted again
to the king’s favour.</p>

<p>After this, there arose a debate betwixt the king and the
queen about votes in the parliament; as the king had two
votes, the queen would have one, and would needs be a parliamenter,
or no peace without the preferment: this matter was
committed to George by the king; so it was agreed among
the parliamenters that the Queen should be admitted into
parliament for a day; and accordingly she came, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
received with all the honour and congratulation, as was due, and
becoming her high station; but before any matter of consequence
was brought to the board, George seated himself hard
by the queen’s seat; all being silent, he rose up quickly, and
lifted one of his legs, and then gave a great fart, which set the
whole house a laughing; whereat the Queen was greatly
offended, crying, Go take the rogue and hang him; to which
George answered, A fine parliamenter indeed, to hang a man
for a sinless infirmity, and that’s a fart. The Queen being so
enraged at this affront put on her first proposal to parliament,
went off in a passion, and never would countenance them any
more. But yet to be revenged on George, she would never
give the King rest till he delivered George into her hands, that
he might be punished at her pleasure: which the king accordingly
commanded to be done, knowing that George would
rescue himself by some intrigue or other. No sooner was he
delivered into her hands, to be at her disposal, but she and her
Maries<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> pronounced his doom, which is as follows: As he had
affronted the Queen among so great an equipage, who ought
to be honoured in chief, and above all women in the nation,
that he should be stoned to death by the hands of women.
Now the time being come that he was to die, according to
their appointment, he was taken into a park, where a great
number of women was waiting upon him, with their aprons
full of stones, to fall upon him, and to put him to death,
according to the queen’s appointment.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When he had ended with these words, The greatest whore
throw the first stone, every one put it to another to cast the
first stone; but knowing they would attain the character of a
whore for so doing, they all refused, till the dying hour was
past, and then he took a protest against them, and by that
mean gained his life.</p>

<p>After this he was admitted to the Queen’s favour and
presence, attending the court as formerly. About this time
the French king not knowing how to pick a quarrel with
Great Britain, sent a letter to the king, desiring it to be read
before the Parliament, and the writing was as follows: Will
I come? Will I come? Will I come?&mdash;This letter being read
before the king and his courtiers, they all concluded that the
French king designed to invade England; therefore they
wrote a letter on purpose to send to him again upbraiding him
with the breach of peace, and putting him in mind of the last
treaty. The answer being read before the King and his Nobles,
they all condescended that it should be sent as an answer; but
George smiling and shaking his head, cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Many men, many minds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who knows what he designs?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>Then they asked George what he thought the French king
meant by such a letter? to which he answered, I suppose he
wants an invitation to come over to dine, and then go back in
a friendly manner; but you are going to charge him with a
breach of peace, before he has given any signal of offence or
war: his letter is indeed dark and mystical, but send him an
answer according to his question. Now George being ordered
to write the answer, it was, And ye come, And ye come, And
ye come. This being sent to the French King, he admired it
beyond expression, saying, It was an answer more valiant and
daring than he expected; so the enmity he intended was
thereby turned into love.</p>

<p>About this time it happened that a malignant party in
Scotland sent up a great spokesman to the King and Parliament,
for the seducing of the church: George hearing of his
coming, went away and met him on the bridge, and the salutation
that he gave him was, the cutting off his head, and
throwing it over the bridge, then ran to the king with all his
might, falling down before him, pleading most heartily for a
pardon, or without it he was a dead man; the king most seriously
asked him what he had done now? to which he answered,
He had only thrown the Scots bishop’s hat over the bridge,
which made the king to laugh, to hear him ask pardon for such
a small fault; but he had no sooner got the pardon sealed by
the King’s hand, then he said, indeed my sovereign, I threw
his hat over the bridge, but his head was in it. Geordy,
Geordy, says the King, thou wilt never give over till thou
be hanged.</p>

<p>After this, a nobleman in England agreed with the King to
put a trick upon George, to try his manly courage, in sending
him to a certain house for a bag of money. On his way home
through St. James’s Park, they caused a sturdy fellow to go
and set the way upon him, and take the money; he being armed
with sword and pistol, came up briskly, and attacked George
with these words, You, Sir, deliver what money you have,
or you are a dead man: to which George answered, Sir I have
money indeed, but ’tis not my own, and I am sorry to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
it; nevertheless, since I am not armed as you are to exchange
blows for it, you shall have it; but pray do me the favour as
to fire your pistol through the flap of my cloak, that the owners
may see I have been in danger of my life before I lost the
money; which he accordingly performed. No sooner had he
fired it, than George whips out his hanger from below his
cloak, and with one stroke cut off his right hand, wherein he
held his sword, so that both his sword and the hand fell to the
ground; but George lifted his hand, and carried it to the
King. No sooner did he come before them, but they asked
him, saying, Well George, did you see any body to trouble
you by the way? No, said he, but one fellow, who was going
to take the money from me; but I made him give me his
hand he would not do the like again. You did, says the fellow’s
master? Yes, I did, says George, let work bear Witness,
throwing down the fellow’s hand on the table before them.</p>

<p>Now this last exploit of George’s caused many of the
English to hate him, and among the rest, a young nobleman
fell a jocking of George, in saying, he would be as famous a
champion for Scotland as Sir William Wallace was: Ay, ay,
says George, William Wallace was a brave man in his time.
True, indeed, says the other, but when he came to London,
we did him all manner of justice, and for honour of the Scots,
we have his effigy in the shite-houses to this very day. And
do you not know the reason of that, says George? No, I don’t,
says he: Well, I’ll tell you, says George, he was such a terror
to the Englishmen when he was alive, that the sight of him
yet makes them beshite themselves. The English took this as
a great affront, and forthwith caused Wallace’s picture to be
taken out of that place.</p>

<p>There was a young English girl in love with a Scotsman,
and petitioned him several times for to marry her, which he
refused, and upon revenge thereof, she went to a Justice, and
<ins class="corr" id="tn-247" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'swore a rap'">
swore a rape</ins> against him, which is death by the law. George
hearing this, went into the prison where the young man was,
and instructed him how to behave before the judge. So in the
time of the trial, George came in, while the judge was crying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
to the man, but never a word could he get him to answer,
to tell whether he was guilty or not. After the judge had
given him over for deaf and dumb, others fell a-shouting in his
ears, but never a word he would speak. Then the judge perceiving
George, called him, saying, George, do you know what is
the matter with this man? Yes I do, very well, says George.
What is it, says the judge? Why, says George, the woman
made such a noise and crying, when he was ravishing her, it
has put the poor man quite deaf, I assure you. Is it so, says
the judge. No, no, says the woman, my lord judge, you may
believe me, I lay as mute as a lamb, and never spoke a word
all the time. Very well confessed, said the judge, and you
have sworn a rape against him; go take the whore to Newgate,
and let the poor man go about his business, and so it
ended.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>


<hr class="r10" />

<div class="chapter" id="wee-II">
<h3 class="lsp2">PART II.</h3>
</div>

<p>George happened one night to be in company with a
Bishop, and so they fell to argumenting anent religion,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
wherein George got the better of him, and the Bishop found
himself he was wrong; then one of the company addressed
himself to George in these words, thou Scot, said he, ought
not have left the country; For what, says George? Because
thou hast brought all the knowledge that is in it along with
thee. No, no, says George, the shepherds in Scotland will
argument with any Bishop in England, and exceed them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
mighty far in knowledge. The English clergy took this as a
great affront, and several noblemen affirmed it to be as George
had said. Wagers were laid thereon, and three of the English
clergy were chosen and sent away to Scotland to dispute it with
the shepherds, accompanied with several gentlemen who were to
bear witness of what they heard pass between them. Now George
knowing what way they were gone, took another road, and came
into the Scots bounds before them, made up his acquaintance
with a shepherd at the border, whose pasture lay hard by the
way side, where the clergymen were to pass; and here George
mounted himself in a shepherd’s dress, and when he saw the
clergymen coming, he conveyed his flock to the road side,
and fell a singing a latin song; and so, to begin the
quarrel, one of them asked him, in French, What o’clock
it was? To which he answered in Hebrew, It is directly
about the time of the day it was yesterday at this time.
Another asked him in Greek, What countryman he was? To
which he answered in Flemish, If you knew that, you would
be as wise as myself. A third asked him in Dutch, Where
was you educate? To which he answered in Earse, herding
my sheep between this and Lochaber. This, they begged
him to explain in English, which he accordingly did. Now,
said they one to another, we need not go any farther, What,
says George, are you butchers? I’ll sell you a few sheep.
To this they made no answer, but went away shamefully,
swearing that the Scots had gone through all the nations in
the world to learn their language, or the devil had taught
them it, for we have no share here but shame.</p>

<p>After that George had ended the dispute with the English
clergymen, he stript of his shepherd’s dress, and up through
England with all the haste imaginable, so that he arrived at
the place from whence they set out, three days before them,
and went every day asking if they were come, so that he
might not be suspected. Now, upon their arrival, all that
were concerned in the matter, and many more, to hear what
news from the Scots shepherds, came crowding in, to know
what was done. No sooner had the three gentlemen declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
what was past between the clergymen and the shepherds, whom
they found on the Scots border, but the old bishop made
answer, and think you, said he, that a shepherd could answer
these questions? It has been none else but the devil, for the
Scots ministers themselves could not do it; they are but
ignorant of such matters; a parcel of beardless boys. Then
George thought it was time to take speech in hand. Well,
my lord bishop, says he, you call them a parcel of ignorant
beardless boys, you have a great long beard yourself, my lord
bishop, and if the grace of God were measured by beards, you
bishops, and the goats will have it all, and that will be quite
averse to scripture. What, says the bishop, are you a Scot?
Yes, says George, I am a Scot: Well, says the bishop, and
what is the difference between a Scot and a sot? Nothing at
present, says George, but the breadth of the table, there being
a table betwixt the bishop and George; so the bishop went
off in a high passion, while the whole multitude were like to
split their jaws with laughter.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>About this time there was an act of parliament for the
benefit of murderers, that any person if they committed
murder, if they forfeited 500 merks, which went under the
name of Kin Boot,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> because so much of this fine went to the
murdered person’s nearest relation, as the price of blood, the
murderer got a remit. Now George knowing this to be contrary
to Moses’ laws, was very much grieved to see many
pardons sealed with the king’s hand for murder, almost one
every week; it being so usual for the king to subscribe them,
that he would not read them, nor enquire what they were:
for which cause George writes a right to the crown, and sent
it to the king to be subscribed, which he actually did, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
never looking what it was, returned it to George; no sooner
had he received it, but he goes to the king, and told him it
was not time for him now to be sitting there, whereat the
king, greatly amazed, started up, then George in great haste
sets himself down on the king’s chair, forthwith declaring
himself king, saying, You who was king must be my fool, for
I am now the wisest man. The king at this was greatly
offended, until George shewed him his seal and superscription;
but, from that day forth the king knew what he subscribed.</p>

<p>The next pardon that came to be sealed by the king, was
to a gentleman who had killed two men before, and had gotten
pardons for them by money. This being the third, the
king looked very silent in looking over the petition, George,
standing by, asked the king what he was going to seal now?
To which he answered, It is a remit for a man who had killed
three men at sundry times, I gave him two remits before.
O! says George, he has killed but one man; and who killed
the other two? says the king; you did, says George, for if
you had given him justice when he had killed the first, he had
killed no more. When the king heard these words, he threw
down the pen, and declared that such an act, to save a
murderer, shall be null ever after by him.</p>

<p>One day after this, George having no money, he goes away
and gets a pick and spade, and then falls a digging at a
corner of the king’s palace, which the king perceiving from
his window, calls what he was wanting there? are you going
to undermine my house, and make it fall? No, my sovereign,
said he, but it is verily reported that there is plenty of money
about this house, and where can it be? I cannot find it; for
it is not within the house to do me service, then surely it must
be below it. O George that is a crave after the new fashion:
What money you want I’ll order it for you. Then, my
sovereign, I’ll dig no more.</p>

<p>One time after this George being in the country, he came
to an inn where he alighted to refresh himself and his horse;
the innkeeper charged him double price for every thing he
called for; George never grumbled at this, but gave him all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
his demands, and away he goes on his journey; and where
he quartered the night following, he was used after the same
manner, if not worse. Now George having little farther to
go, he returned the next day, and came that night to the inn
where he refreshed himself the day before; so when he
alighted, the boy asking him, sir, what shall I give your horse?
What you will, boy, says George. No sooner had he gone into
his room, but the drawer asked him, What will you have to
drink, sir. What you will, says George. The master of the
inn came into his room before supper, asking him, What will
you have for supper, sir? What you will, landlord, says
George. Now after supper being ended, and a hearty bowl to
put all over, George went to bed, and got up pretty early in
the morning, he called for the boy to make ready his horse in
all haste, for he designed to mount him and go directly: so
in a short time he went into the stable where the boy was,
calling for his horse, when he mounting him with all the speed
he could, and giving the boy a piece of money, saying, here,
my boy, this is for your taking care of my horse, I have paid
for all I called for in the house, and off he goes. Now, about
mid day, he alighted again at an inn to refresh himself and
his horse, and there he chanced to be in company with his
other landlord, where he was the night before, and charged
him with the double reckoning, so George addressed himself
to him as follows: Sir, says George, I do believe I was in your
house yesternight. Oh yes, sir, I mind of you pretty well;
and where was you last night? Last night! says George, I
was in one of the finest inns, and the civilest landlord I ever
had in my life; they brought all things that I stood in need
of unto me without calling for it, and when I came off this
morning, they charged me nothing, and I paid nothing but
sixpence to the boy for dressing my horse. Blood and wounds,
said the old fellow, then I’ll go there this night. Ay, says
George, do; and mind this, when they ask you what you will
have for your horse, answer nothing, but what you will, sir.
Now George smiled within himself, to think how he had got
the one extortioner to take amends of the other. So the fore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>said
innkeeper rode that night until many of the people of
the inn were gone to bed before he came. No sooner was he
alighted from his horse, than the boy asked him, What shall
I give to your horse, master? To which he answered, What
you will, boy. The boy hearing this, he runs away (leaving
him and his horse to stand at the door), up stairs to his
master’s room, crying, Master, Master, What you will is come
again? O the rogue, cries he, where is he? I’ll cane him, I’ll
what you will him by and by, and to him he runs with his
cane, licks and kicks him until he was scarce able to mount
his horse, and would give him no entertainment there; which
caused him to ride the whole length of a cold winter night,
after he had got his bones all beat and bruised. So the one
pursued the other as a murderer; and his defence was, that
he was a cheat and a scorner of his house, until the truth was
found out.</p>

<p>About this time the French king sent and demanded from
the king of England three men of different qualities; the first
was to be a mighty strong man, the other a very wise man,
and the third a great fool: so that he might have none in
all France to match them in their stations. So accordingly
there were two men chosen, the one a strong man, and the
other a wise man, but George was to act as a fool: nevertheless,
he was the teacher of the other two. On their way to
France, George asked the strong man, what will you answer
the French king, if he ask if you be a strong man? I’ll say I
am. Then, says George, he’ll possibly get a stronger man
than you, who may kill you and affront your country. What
shall I say then? said the strong man. Why, says George,
tell him you are strong enough untried. Then, says George
to the wise man, and what will you say to the king, when he
asks if you are a wise man? I’ll tell him I am, and answer
him all the questions I know. Very well, says George, and
what if he ask you what you do not know, then you’ll affront
your country, and be looked upon as a greater fool than me.
What shall I answer then? said the wise man. Why, says
George, tell him, he is only a wise man that can take care of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
himself; and I shall come in after you, and take care of you
all together. No sooner were they arrived at the king’s
palace, than the king sent for them to try them. The strong
man being first called for, he goes; then the king asked him,
Are you a strong man? to which he answered, O king, I am
strong enough untried; very good, said the king. After him
entered the wise man, to whom the king put the question, sir,
are you a wise man? to which he answered, He is only a wise
man who can take care of himself: very good, says the king.
With that George pushed up the door, and in he goes with
loud laughter, pisses directly in the king’s face, which blinded
both his eyes, and put the whole court in amaze. Now, now,
says the king, it is true enough what the Wise man says, for
if I had taken care of myself, I need not have been pissed
upon by the English fool. O no, says George, fools always
strive to make fools of others, but Wise men make fools of
themselves. The king imagined as much as he was made the
greatest fool, and charged them forthwith to go home, for he
wanted no more of England’s strength, wisdom, or folly.</p>

<p>One night after this, a Highland drover chanced to have a
drinking bout with an English captain of a ship, and at last
the English captain and him came to be very hearty over
their cup; so that they called in their servants to have a share
of their liquor; the drover’s servant looked like a wild man,
going without breeches, stockings or shoes, not so much as
a bonnet on his head, with a long peel’d rung in his hand.
The captain asked him how long it was since he catched
him? it is about two years since I haul’d him out of the sea
with a net, and afterwards he ran into the mountains, where I
catched him with a pack of hounds. The captain believed it
was so; but, says he, I have a servant the best swimmer in
Europe. O but, says the drover, my servant will swim him
to death. No, says the captain, I’ll lay 200 guineas<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> on it.
Then says the drover, I hold it one for one, and stakes
it directly, the day being appointed when the trial was to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
made. Now, the drover, when he came to himself, thinking
on what a bargain he had made, did not know what <ins class="corr" id="tn-255" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to do, do, knowing'">
to do, knowing</ins> very well his servant could swim none. He
hearing of George, being in town, who was always a good
friend to a Scotsman; he went unto him, and told him the
whole story, and that he would be entirely broke, and durst
never return to his own country, for he was sure to lose it.
Now George called the drover and his servant aside, and
instructed them how to bring him off with safety, and gain
too; so accordingly they met at the place appointed; the
captain’s servant stripped directly, and threw himself into the
sea, taking a turn until the highlandman was ready, for the
drover took some time to put his servant in order: after he
was stripped, his master took his plaid, and rolled a kebbock of
cheese, a big loaf, and a bottle of gin in it, and this he bound
on his shoulders, giving him a direction to tell his wife and
children that he was well; to be sure he returned with an
answer against that day se’ennight. So as he went into the
sea, he looked back to his master, and call’d out to him for his
claymore. And, what waits he for now? says he who was to
swim along with him. He wants his sword, says his master;
his sword! says the fellow, what is he to do with a sword?
Why, says his master, if he meets with a Whale or a monstrous
beast, it is to defend his life; I know he’ll have to fight his
way through the north seas, e’er he go to Lochaber. Then,
cries the other, I’ll swim none with him, if he takes his sword.
Ay, but, says the master, you shall, or lose the wager; take
you another sword with you. No, says the fellow, I never did
swim with a sword, nor any man else, that ever I saw or heard
of; I know not but that wild man will kill me in the deep water;
I would not for the whole world venture myself with him and
a sword. The captain seeing his servant afraid to venture, or
if he did, he would never see him again alive; therefore, he
desired an agreement with the drover, who at first seemed
unwilling; but the captain put it in his will, the drover
quit him for an hundred guineas. This he came to through
George’s advice.</p>

<p>After this, George being in Cornwall about some business
where he chanced to run short of money, and not knowing
what to do, being acquainted with none in that country, and
knowing his landlord to be loyal to the government, and a
great favourite to the king his master; takes a piece of brick,
and brays it to a small powder mixed with a little chalk, so
that it might seem, in colour, like arsenick which is strong
poison; then tying it up in papers, writing on this direction,
the strongest poison for the king, and on another paper, the
slower poison for the queen. Out he goes on purpose, and
leaves the papers lying on a table, where he knew they would
be looking at them; the landlord perceived the direction; so
in comes George in a great haste, and calls out, O landlord,
did you see two small bundles I have lost, and I know not
what I shall do, for it was my main business to take them to
London.&mdash;O! you murdering rogue! cries the landlord, I’ll
have you hanged for what you intend. George at this made
off, and was going to fly for it, but the landlord called for
assistance; so he was apprehended, and made prisoner of
state, and carried him to London by a troop of horse; when
the people there began to know him, and tell what he was, his
guard slipt away shamefully, and left him; so George thanked
them for their good company and save convoy.</p>

<p>There was a law made against wearing swords at balls and
assemblies, in the reign of King James VI. because they were
inconvenient on these occasion; but George, to be witty on
the act, provided himself with a very long scabbard, and got
himself introduced to a ball, where the king and his court were
present; George made several turns through the company,
making his scabbard hit against their shins, and sometimes
slipt it below a lady’s fardingale; and, in short, molested the
company so much, that he was taken notice of, and seized as
a person who had incurred the penalties of the act aforesaid.
But George excused himself, telling them, that the law was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
only against swords, and as he only wore a scabbard, was no
ways liable. At seeing this, the king and his court were convinced
that the law was imperfect, and that George had more
wit than themselves.</p>

<p>George, one day easing himself at the corner of a hedge,
was espied by an English ’squire, who began to mock him, asking
him, Why did he not keckle like the hens? But George
whose wit was always ready, told him, He was afraid to keckle
lest he would come and snatch up the egg. Which rebuff
made the ’squire walk off as mute as a fish.</p>

<p>George was professor of the College of St. Andrews, and
slipt out one day in his gown and slippers, and went to his
travels through Italy, and several other foreign countries; and
after seven years, returned with the same dress he went off in;
entered the college, and took a possession of his seat there; but
the professor in his room quarrelled him for so doing. Ay,
says George, it is a very odd thing that a man cannot take a
walk out in his slippers, but another will take up his seat; and
so set the other professor about his business.</p>

<p>George was met one day by three bishops, who paid him the
following compliments. Says the first, Good day, father
Abraham; says the second, Good day, father Isaac; says the
third, Good day, father Jacob. To which he replied, I’m
neither father Abraham, father Isaac, nor father Jacob; but
I am Saul, the son of Kish, sent out to seek my father’s asses,
and lo! I have found three of them. Which answer convinced
the bishops that they had mistaken their man.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>A poor Scotsman dined one day at a public house in
London upon eggs, and not having money to pay, got credit
till he should return. The man being lucky in trade, acquired
vast riches, and after some years returned, and calling at the
house where he was owing his dinner of eggs, asked the landlord
what he had to pay for his dinner of eggs he had got
from him such a time? The landlord seeing him now rich,
gave him a bill of some hundred pounds; telling him, as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
reason for so extravagant a charge, that these eggs, had they
been hatched, would have been chickens; and these laying
more eggs, would have been more chickens; and so on, multiplying
the eggs and their product till such time as their value
amounted to the sum he charged. The man refusing to comply
with his demand, was charged before a judge; but mean
time, made the matter known to George Buchanan his countryman,
who promised to appear in the hour of cause, which he
accordingly did, all in a sweat, with a great basket of boil’d
pease: which appearance surprised the judge, who asked him,
what he meant by these boil’d peas? Says George, I am
going to sow them. When will these grow? says the judge:
They will grow when sodden eggs grow chickens. Which
answer convinced the judge of the extravagance of the Englishman’s
demand, and the Scotsman was assoilized on paying
twopence halfpenny.</p>

<p>There was a bell at Dalkieth, which the Popish clergy made
use of to extort confessions from the ignorant people, in the
following manner: They told the persons whom they suspected
guilty, that the bell would rive at the touch of a guilty person,
but if not guilty, it would not; by this means they generally
frightened the ignorant into confessions; for if the bell would
rive, the person was then to be condemned to death; but
they magnified the matter so, that the bell was never put to
the trial, till George did as follows: he was taken up for saying,
that the pope was fallible himself, and could not pardon
the sins of others. George owned he said so, but would refer
to the bell whether he was guilty or not. The priests, though
unwilling, were obliged to comply. George touched the bell,
repeating as before, The Pope is fallible, and cannot pardon
sin, moreover added, The Pope and Popish clergy are impostors;
and thereupon touched the bell, referring to it for the
truth; but the bell not renting, the priests were disgraced as
impostors, and he was honourably acquited, and the bell was
laid aside.</p>

<p>George desired a member of the College of St. Andrews to
lend him a book: the other told him, he could not possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
spare it out of his chamber, but if he pleased he might come
there and read all the day long. Some time after the gentleman
sends to George to borrow his bellows; but he sent him
word, he could not possibly spare them out of his chamber,
but he might come there and blow all the day if he would.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>A scholar at the grammar school of St. Andrews, coming
into a room where the master had laid down a basket of
cherries for his own eating, the waggish boy takes it up, and
cries aloud, I publish the banns between these cherries and
my mouth, if any know any just cause or impediment, why
these two should not be joined together, let them declare
it. The master being in the next room, overheard all that
was said; and, coming into the school, he ordered the boy
who had eaten his cherries to be taken up, or, as he called it,
horsed on another boy’s back: but before he proceeded to the
usual discipline, he cries out aloud, as the delinquent had done,
I publish the banns between this boy’s breeches and my taws:
if any one knows any just cause or impediment why these
two should not be joined together, let them declare it. George
passing by in the mean time, overheard this proclamation; I
forbid the banns, cried he. Why so, says the schoolmaster?
Because the parties are not agreed, replied he. Which answer
so pleased the master, that the boy was set down without any
punishment.</p>

<p>A young gentleman that wanted to be witty on the scriptures,
eating some cheese full of mites, one night at a tavern;
now, said he, I have done as much as Sampson, for I have
slain my thousands and ten thousands. Yes, replied George,
who happened to be in his company, and with the same
weapon too, the jaw-bone of an ass; which answer set the
whole company a laughing to see the young gentleman beat
with his own weapon.</p>

<p>George being in company where three bishops were present
at dinner, they knowing George to be a great scholar, and
comical withal, they put upon him to say the grace, which he
did as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here are three brethren of the coat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who for thy blessings thank thee not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curse them, Lord, and bless them not. Amen.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fall on gentlemen, the cause is good. This grace made the
bishops look like fools to one another, while George laughed
heartily at the confusion they were in.</p>

<p>A candle maker having had some candles stole, was telling
it in a company where George was present, who bade him be
of good cheer, for in a short time says he, I am assured they
will come to light.</p>

<p>George being sent to Paris about some business, went from
thence to Versailles, to see the French king’s court: and being
known there to several of the courtiers, who had been at the
English court, one of them took occasion to tell the French
King, that George was one of the wittiest men in England;
upon which the French King desired to see him, which he did;
but George, it seems, was out of humour, or at least seemingly
so, he spoke but very little to the purpose; so that the French
King told the nobleman that had commended him for such a
wit, that he looked upon him as a very dull fellow; but the
nobleman assured the King that whatever he thought of him,
George was a very witty and ingenious man: whereupon the
King was resolved to make further trial of him, and took him
into a great gallery, where there were abundance of fine
pictures; and, among the rest, shewed him a picture of Christ
on the cross, and asked him, If he knew who that was? but
George made himself very ignorant, and answered, no; Why,
says the King, I’ll tell you, if you don’t know; this is the
picture of our Saviour on the cross, and that on the right is
the Pope’s, and that on the left is my own. Whereupon
George replied, I humbly thank your majesty for the information,
for though I have often heard that our Saviour was
crucified between two thieves, yet I never knew who they
were before.</p>

<p>A sharper who had acquired vast riches by cheating, told
George, that if such a thing as a good name was to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
purchased, he would freely give ten thousand pounds for one.
Sir, said George, it would certainly be the worst money you
ever laid out in your life. Why so? said the sharper; because
answered he, you will lose it again in less than a week.</p>

<p>One asked George, why men always made suit to the women,
and the women never to the men? Why, says he, because
the women are always ready for the men, but the men are not
always ready for the women.</p>

<p>George went into the mint one day, when they were melting
gold, one of them asked George, if he would have his hat full
of gold? George readily accepted, but it burnt the bottom
out of his hat, as they knew it would, and for that bout they
fooled George. However George, to be up with them, bought
a fine large hat, and caused a plate of copper to be put betwixt
the hat and the lining, and returned next day, they jestingly
asked him if he would have another hatful of gold? he said
he would; they gave it red hot, and now George laughed at
them in his turn, telling them, that this new hat was a good
one, and stood fire better than the old one; and so carried it
off honestly; and being afterwards prosecute for to return it, he
excused himself, telling the judge, that he took nothing but
what was given him; and therefore he was honourably
acquitted, and the others heartily laughed at.</p>

<p>In the reign of king James the Sixth, George dining one
day with the Lord Mayor, after two or three healths the
ministry was tossed; but when it came to George’s turn to
drink he diverted it some time by telling a story to the person
who sat next him; the chief magistrate not seeing his toast
go round, called out, What sticks the ministry at? At
nothing, cries George, and so drank off his glass.</p>

<p>George being one day along with the king and his nobles
a-hunting, and being but very sorrily mounted; when he was
spurring up his horse, he observed the horse have a trick of
falling down on his knees. George immediately thought how
he should make use of that very thing to divert his Majesty;
therefore pretended that his horse could set hares, and knowing
some hare-seats, rode that way, to show the truth of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
he affirmed; and when he had found the hare, by giving his
horse a spur, he immediately clapped down; this he repeated
several times, till he put the whole company in belief that
what he said was true; and one of the noblemen being
charmed with the performance of George’s horse, would have
George to change with him; George seemed, at first, unwilling
to part with his horse; but at last was prevailed upon to part
with him for the nobleman’s horse, and a hundred guineas to
boot. But afterwards riding thro’ a pretty deep river, the
nobleman spurring his new horse, he clapped down on his
belly; which George seeing, called out to the company to
return with the dogs, for the nobleman’s horse had certainly
set a hare: which set the whole company a-laughing. The
poor nobleman was obliged to leave his horse set in the water,
and waded through on foot, all wet to the shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>A Scotsman being reduced to poverty, made his court to
George to put him in a way; George told him he would,
provided he would do as he directed him. There was an old
miser, an usurer and money-changer hard by; George ordered
the poor fellow to pretend an errand to the miser, and when
he came to the table where the heaps of money lay, to thrust
his hand among the gold, but to lift none, and run off. This
the poor fellow did, and was chased by the miser and his
servants, who ran after him into the street, calling stop the
thief; the poor fellow was stopt, (as George had desired him
to let them catch him). George appeared in the mob, and
went along with the poor fellow, who was carried before
a judge, where he was searched; and nothing being found
upon him, he was acquitted, and the miser fined in a large
sum for accusing him. Afterwards George desired him to go
to the same place, and thrust in both his hands, and lift up as
much as he could and run off. This he did, but the miser
told him, he was not such a fool as to follow him, for he knew
he only desired to play the fool to have him fined again. By
this means the poor fellow was enriched, and afterwards lived
honestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>George being at dinner one day, where the broth was very
hot, burnt his mouth, and at the same time letting go a loud
fart; It is very good for you, says George, that you made
your escape, for I should have burnt you alive had you staid.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="wee-IV">
<h3 class="lsp2">PART IV.</h3>
</div>

<p>A young curate, with more pertness than wit or learning,
being asked in company, how he came to take it into his head
to enter into the ministry of the church? Because, said he,
the Lord hath need of me. That may be, replied George, who
was present, for I have often heard that the Lord had once
need of an ass.</p>

<p>After this, George being sent with the British ambassador
into Italy, by the way of Paris; and as they were viewing the
beautiful statues, and large buildings of that spacious city:
the King, and many of his nobles in company, as they were
walking through the King’s garden, among the images of the
saints, they came to the image of the virgin Mary, who stood
in a melancholy posture with the babe in her arms, one of the
noblemen says to the British ambassador, don’t you think but
she looks as she were angry? O yes, says George, she’s angry
when she sees Englishmen and Frenchmen in friendship and
unity one with another. No, no, said the French king she
loves nothing better than the reconciliation of enemies; peace
and unity is her delight. Then George gets in below the
statue, and looks up; O, says George, I know what is the
matter now, some body has driven a great nail in her arse, I
see the head of it sticking out, it would vex any living be’s a
piece of wood. At this the king was greatly enraged against
George for saying so, for calling her a piece of wood; and
nothing would satisfy the King, unless that George would fall
down and worship the Virgin Mary, and crave mercy of her
for the blasphemous reproaches wherewith he hath reproached
her. Then George cries out, O may it please your majesty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
omit it at this time, I dare not look her in the face, she frowns
on me with such an angry countenance, this dutiful command
of your’s must be delayed until I return from Italy, and then
I shall fulfill your demand, in paying all dutiful respects and
worship unto her, according to what she is. So here the ambassador
stood bound for George, that he should perform this
piece of worship at his return, according to the king’s pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, during their stay in Italy, they chanced to be in a nobleman’s
house where they kept but few servants, because of a
spirit that did haunt the house for the space of 200 years before
that time, so that no servant could work any kind of
labour in or about the house for it, except cooks, for what they
vulgarly called a Brownie, it did all itself, and would suffer no
fellow labourer to work along with it. On the next morning,
George got up pretty early, called for water to wash himself;
then directly comes the Brownie with a bason of water in the one
hand, and a clean cloth in the other. George perceiving him
having such a pale ghostly countenance, not to be an earthly
creature said, of what nation art thou? To which it answered
in Galic or Earse, a countryman of yours, Sir. The ambassador
smiled, and joked George, telling him, it was a devil, and how
could it be a countryman of his? O, says George, I’ll show you
the contrary of that, for the devil dare not stay in our country,
George having washed himself, it came again to take away the
bason and water; then says George, and how long is it since
you left your own country? About 250 years ago, says it.
Then certainly, says he, thou art a devil, and not an earthly
creature. To which he answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I am what I am, and a Christian too.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I am what I am to conjure you. (says George.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He taking a handful of water, and throwing it on the old
withered face of it, repeating the form of the words of baptism
of Earse; saying, if thou be a Christian, thou art old
enough now to be baptized. No sooner had he done this, but
it went off weeping and crying, O! let never a rogue put trust
in his countryman after me. Now, says George, I told you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
the devil dare not stay in my country, nor yet look a Scotsman
in the face in his own. Why, says the Italian lord, do you
imagine, that this is the devil’s own country? It appears so
says George, for he is the oldest residenter in it I know; but
my lord, said he, and if it please your grace, I think the
clergymen are very scant in this country, when you have kept
the devil so long for a chaplain. The nobleman unto this gave
no answer, but expressed his sorrow to be very great for the
loss of his Brownie.</p>

<p>Now the ambassador having done his business in Italy they
returned homeward, and on their way, the ambassador began
to question George how he thought to escape Paris without
committing idolatry. No, no, says George, I never did worship
any image, nor never shall; but I shall make them worship
the worst that is in my guts. No sooner were they
arrived in Paris, but George leaves the ambassador, and goes
directly to the Virgin Mary, jumps in over the rail to the holy
ground (as they termed it) whereon she stood, where few durst
go but priests and friars; and there he loosed his breeches,
and made such a groaning, easing himself, that he was heard at
a distance by the priests and friars who were walking near by,
and they perceiving this heinous abomination, ran upon him
like a pack of hounds, and carried him before the cardinals and
Father confessors, where he was allowed to speak for himself,
which he did as follows&mdash;May it please your most excellent
Worships to hear my reasons, before you pronounce my
sentence to be put in execution against me. It was my fortune
to be passing through this city a few months ago, with the
British ambassador, on our way to Italy; and one day being
walking in the kings garden in presence of the king, and many
of his nobles, who can bear witness to the truth of the same;
I being ignorant of your traditions and rites of religion, foolishly
offended, reproaching the Virgin Mary to her face; and ever
since she has plagued me with a boundness in my belly, that
I have voided nothing but clean hach; so now on my return
I went and implored her to open my fundament, and she has
done so; I being overjoyed at the miraculous healing, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
getting passage in her presence, I left it as a memorial of the
miracle in that place. When hearing this, they all with one
consent, lifted up their hands and blessed the Virgin Mary for
the wonderful miracle she had done; and ordered George to
go about his business, and declare unto all what was done, to
him by the holy Virgin, for the confirmation of their religion.
So all the devout Romans came to view his dung, and worship
over it; the king himself kneeled down, and worshipped, bowing
his body over it, in presence of many people; and also
caused a holy day to be observed thro’ all his dominions, for
the miraculous cure.</p>

<p>Now George being a long time absent from Britain, he
thought to go and visit the king and his court in disguise.
He meeting with an old man driving two old horses, loaded
with coals to sell. George here makes a bargain with the old
man, for the loan of his clothes, his horses and coals, whip, and
every thing to complete him as a real coal-driver; so away he
goes in this dress, until he came before the king’s palace, where
he began to cry with an audible voice, Buy coals, buy coals;
better buy than borrow. Now the king being in company
with his young chaplain, who was a foundling, none knew his
original, and had been suffered and educated out of charity
by the king’s father, yet he was become as proud as lucifer,
and as proud in his own conceit as the king himself. Now,
the king knowing George’s voice, tho’ he was in a coalman’s
dress, desired the chaplain to ask the coalman why he called so
loud, making such a terrible noise. The chaplain opened the
window, and with great airs called unto him, You, Sir, why do
you cry so for? Why, says George, I cry for people to come
and buy my coals, and give me money for them; but what do
you cry for? What, sir, says the young priest, I cry for you
to hold your peace. Then, says George, come here then, and
cry for me, and go sell my coals, and I will hold my peace.
Sell my coals, says the priest, do you know unto whom you
speak? Yes, I do know, says George, but you do not. What
are you? says the priest; I am a mortal, and so are you, says
George. What is your father’s name, since you will not tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
your own? says the priest: You may go ask that at my
mother, says George, for I was not sufficient when she got me
to know him. What, says the priest, do you not know your
own father? I know my mother, and my mother did know
my father, says George, and that is sufficient, and more than
you can say, perhaps. The priest thinking he was coming too
near him, thought to put him off with a scriptural question,
by asking him, If he knew who was Melchizedec’s father?
Indeed, master priest, says George, Melchizedec’s descent was
not counted, neither is yours, then who can declare your
generation? The priest, at this answer, would stand the
argument no longer, but closed the window in great haste,
while the king, and all who knew the priest to be a foundling,
were like to split their sides laughing; so George went off
with his coals, and the priest became more humble than he
was, formerly, for he thought that every body knew who he
was, when the coalman knew so well.</p>

<p>One night after this, an English ’squire, who profess’d to
be better versed in poetry than George, laid a wager with
another gentleman, five guineas against one, that George
could not metre the first words he would say to him in
the morning, when newly awaked out of his sleep: so the
gentleman went the night before, and told George the story,
and bade him be on his guard, for in the morning they would
certainly come, and that right early. At midnight and you
will, says George, I’ll order my servant to let you in. So the
English ’squire sat up all night conferring with his friends,
whether to put a high verse to him, or mean and simple words,
thinking George would be sitting up all night meditating on an
answer; so they all agreed, that mean and simple words he
would not be thinking on, and have no answer provided for
such. Then away they came in the morning very early, with
several gentlemen in company to hear the diversion. George’s
servant opened the door according to his master’s orders.
The ’squire entered the room first, and wakened George out
of his sleep, then said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rise up you madman, and put on your cloathes.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To which George answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O thou hast lost thy wad man, for I’m none of those.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The English ’squire confessed he was fairly beat, and would
match him with no more. Then another gentleman would
hold five guineas, that he would give him a word or line, that
he could not metre at the first answer; and to answer it
directly as soon as he had done speaking; but George ordered
him first to table the money, and then to proceed, which he
did in all haste; and said as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">My belly rumbl’d, and then I farted.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">George gripping to the money, answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">A fool and his money is soon parted.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then they all cried out, he was fairly beat, and what George
had said, was realy true; but he never would lay any more
wagers concerning poetry.</p>

<p>After this George got a letter from a bishop, telling him,
that he was coming to visit him, and take dinner with him in
his lodging; George sent an answer, that he would wait upon
his lordship at the day appointed; but well did George know,
it was not for any love he had unto him, he was coming to
visit him, but to spy fairlies; therefore he thought he should
give him something to talk about. So George sent his servant
to a bookseller’s shop to buy a dozen of small pamphlets, about
a halfpenny a piece; such as a groat’s worth of wit for a penny,
the history of the king and the cobler, and such pieces as these;
taking all his own books away, and putting the pamphlets in
their place, which he presented to the bishop, when he asked
for a sight of his library. What, says the bishop, have you no
more books but these? No more, says George, but my bible;
just no more. O! says the bishop, I wonder how you can either
speak plain, or write a perfect sentence, when you have no other
books than these. O! says George, do you think that I am a
clergyman, to borrow other men’s sermons to beautify my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
works: no, no, not I: all that I write I dite, I meditate out of
my own brain. This check concerning borrowing put the
bishop in a cold sweat, yet he concealed his passion. Then
George called to his servant, if dinner was ready yet? to which
he answered, Come, master, come, the pot is on the boil, get
out the meal pock: then George came into the room where
his servant was, and set the bishop at the one side of the fire,
and sat down on the other himself, while his servant made a
great bowl full of milk brose, and set them between the bishop
and George; then George desired his lordship to ask a blessing
to what they were to receive, the bishop did not know what
he meaned by a blessing, it not being usual for the English to
do so, asked at George what it was? But George took up a
great ram horn spoon, and put it in the bishop’s hand, saying,
There it is, my lord. What, says the bishop, call you that a
blessing? we call that a spoon. O my lord, says George, it
is the best blessing you can ask, if you do not come empty.
Well, says the bishop, and how do you call that scalded meal?
says George, we call it Scots brose. O! said the bishop, I
cannot eat it. O! says he, the thing we cannot eat we sup,
my lord, since you are in a Scotsman’s house, you must partake
of a Scotsman’s victuals. Then says the bishop, I always
thought the Scots lived well till now; I would not be a Scotsman
for the world. O said George, if a Scotsman live but
twenty years, and get but nineteen years meat, he cannot be
badly off. What, not badly off, and want a year’s victuals?
said the bishop; upon my word of honour, if I wanted one
days victuals, I’d be sure to die the next. O, says George,
we drink water when we cannot do better, and that puts us
in remembrance of wealth; for a dish of contentment is good
cheer. Then, said the bishop, I’ll drink water too if it be
good for the memory. Ay do; said George, and you’ll
remember me when you do so. Now, after dinner, the
bishop took his leave of George, and desired him next day
to come and dine with him.</p>

</div>

<p>Next day, George, according to his promise, went to the
bishop’s lodging; but no sooner did the bishop see George,
than he saluted him with these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your servant, master wise man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And yet you have no books:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How can one have knowledge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That no man instructs?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">George answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your servant, master bishop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Your salutation’s good:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your knowledge is in your library,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While other’s is in their hood.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, after a sumptuous dinner, the bishop took George into
his library, showing him a great quantity of books; which
George praised very much, and among the rest, was an old
Hebrew Bible, which George taking up, asked the bishop what
book it was? the bishop looking at it very sincerely, said he
could not tell. Why then do you keep a book, you don’t
know the name of? It may be the book of black art. No,
I don’t think that, said the bishop, but can you tell what it is?
Yes, says George, it is the Bible, the best book for a bishop I
know, if he had eyes to see the inside of it. So he desired
George to read a piece of it: but when he did, he could not
understand it; therefore, he desired him to explain it: which
sentence he did as follows, Isaiah ix. 19, “For the leaders of
this people cause them to err: and they that are led of them,
are destroyed.” To which George added, This is the blind
leading the blind. So, taking his leave of the bishop, he
parted with him, saying these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Good night, hail master bishop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of books you have great store;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet cannot read the half of them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then what use are they for?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the clergymen in England desired greatly to be in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
company of George, because of his comical and witty expressions;
so George happened one night to be called into a company,
where there were two bishops, as also a priest who
wanted to be licensed by them. One of the bishops asked
George, why the people in Scotland did not love bishops?
Because, says George, they are like old beggars, advanced to
be rulers over barrow-men, still instructing them in things they
know not themselves, ordering them to carry stones to the
builders, which they will not receive, and which they themselves
had never power to move; the Scots having knowledge
of this, hate to see bishops have great lordships for their
ignorance, and the poor labourer have little or nothing for
their toil. One of the bishops looking at George, with an
angry countenance, answered, saying, You Scot must be made
a bishop yourself, and we bishops made priests, and that will
serve well for your turn. No, no, said George, that will not
do; for if I be made a bishop, I’ll have no broken bishops to
serve as priests under me, for they are such bad masters
they’ll become the worst of all servants. At this the two
bishops left the room in a great passion, leaving George and
the young priest only by themselves. Now, now, says George,
this proves the bishops to be but hirelings, and not true shepherds,
pointing to the young priest, you see they are fled for
their own safety and they have left you a lamb, before the
mouth of me a fox, and who knows but I may worry you!
Run, run, too, master sheep, says George, and if you have eyes
guide them two blind shepherds down stairs, and over ditches,
but I am afraid you’ll tumble all in a ditch together. This
raised such an indignation in the bishops’ breasts, that they
desired no more of George’s company or conversation.</p>

<p>One time after this, George being in the country about
twenty miles from London, and on his way homeward, came
up after him a fine gilded coach, which George being informed
belonged to the bishop of Canterbury, and was going to
London for his lordship; George addresses himself to the
coachman, for to have a passage with him in the coach to
London; so he bargained with the coachman for two dollars
to carry him to the Bell inn on London bridge; the one he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
gave him in hand, as he entered the coach door, and the other
he was to give him as soon as ever he would see him come
out at the coach door; so away the coachman drives for
London in all haste; in which time George wrote the following
MOTTO:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here sits the bishop of Canterbury,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who at the schools disdain’d to tarry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far better skill’d at games than preaching.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although he lives by others teaching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blind leaders of the blind indeed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis blind and lame who chariots need,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Six brutes with eyes, this brute doth carry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I mean the bishop of Canterbury.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My feet being lame, I gave a dollar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be drove in state like you a scholar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For which, myself I do abhor;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shame caus’d me make another door.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines George battered upon the inside of the coach,
and when he came within a mile of London, took a knife, and
cut a great hole in the backside of the coach, where he came
out; and to make his promise good to the coachman, that he
was to give him the other dollar as soon as ever he saw him
come out at the coach-door. The poor coachman drove on
till he came to the foresaid inn, where he alighted and opened
the door to let out his passenger; but seeing the coach empty,
and a great hole in the backside of it, he cried out, he believed
he had had the devil in the coach, and that he had taken away
the backside of it with him. The people of the inn came all
flocking about to see what was done, and then perceiving the
lines on the inside of the coach, which the bishop came and
read himself, they all concluded it to be done by George, but
could make nothing of it; for, the bishop said, to pursue him
might make it worse, but no better.</p>

<p>George was invited one day by a great lawyer to come and
see a new building which he had lately built of fine freestone
and marble. He desired George to guess what it was built
with; George answers, Do you think that I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
what it is built with: No, you do not, says the lawyer: Yes,
I do, says George; it cannot stand long, for malice and
hatred is the mortar of it, and the stones are the heads of
foolish people, polished over with the tongue of an ass. What,
says the lawyer, do you compare me to an ass? O! sir, don’t
you remember that an ass was made an advocate, and spoke
against Balaam. The lawyer to this would give no answer,
but took good night of George.</p>

<p>Three merchants, pedlars (as they professed to be) came
with a pack of goods, to put a trick upon a widow Woman
who kept an inn on the highway side; after they had drunk
very hearty, they desired the Woman to lay up the pack
securely, and charged her strictly, before witnesses, to deliver
it to none of them, unless they came altogether for it again,
and in about three weeks thereafter, two of them returned and
desired the woman to give them the pack: telling her, that
the other man was gone to such a fair with another
pack, where they were all to meet; and that they were
fellow-travellers, conjunct in trade, and how they all had a
right to the pack alike; whereupon the poor simple Woman,
not dreading any further harm, gave them the pack. So in a
few days thereafter, the other man comes and demands the
pack; the honest Woman told him plainly, that the other two
men had been there before, and got it away: then he began
to demonstrate to the Woman, what great danger she was in,
and forthwith raised a process against her by law, which cost
the poor Woman a vast of money to defend, as the plea continued
more than two full years: and a great court being one
day to sit upon the process to decide it, which would undoubtedly
have been done in favour of the pursuer, the proof
being so clear, and the woman herself not denying what the
bargain was when she got the pack to keep. The poor
Woman being in great straits, her purse being turned empty,
and her attorney told her plainly, as her money was done, he
could no longer defend her; the Woman once more plucked
up her heart, and went to London to employ a new attorney to
speak for her; but for want of gold, she could get none to
undertake it. George being in a house where he heard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
poor Woman making a mournful complaint to one of her
attornies, who gave her no comfort or satisfaction; for when
she told him, she had no money to spend, or give in defence of
it, the attorney went away and would hear no more of the
Woman’s grievous complaint, which made George to laugh
very heartily, while the poor Widow sat weeping like one distracted.
Poor woman, says George, you need not think that
man will speak a word for you, or any else, unless you had
brought him a purse of gold to loose his tongue; but as I have
got a scheme in the matter, you may go home, and have
patience until the time come; and then, my life for yours, poor
Woman, that I shall send you an attorney, who will do your
business for nothing. He gave the poor Woman more courage
than any she had spoken with in London; for every one told
her, that all the attornies in the World could not free her. So
accordingly at the day appointed, George dressed himself
like an attorney with his gown, and every thing as he had been
really so. The court being fenced, and the process read over,
expences and the value of the pack, having amounted to above
seven hundred pounds, was ordered to be put in decreet
against the poor Widow, which every one was bemoaning, but
could give her no relief. Now George kept himself silent,
hearing them all with great patience, until the very nick of
time, he thought proper to address himself to the judges as
followeth. My lords, judges and gentlemen of this honourable
Court and company, I have come from London, gratis, out of
pure pity, to speak a word or two in favour of this poor
Woman, who hath exhausted all her means in defence of
a false accusation charged against her; and now when her
money is gone, her speakers are dumb, and I see none to
plead the cause of this poor Widow. Now, when sentence is
upon the tapis of being pronounced against her, I earnestly
desire this court to modify and drop the expences altogether.
It is enough when the poor Woman has the pack to pay: for
you all know the woman was no way enriched by it, when the
other two men got it away. Then the pursuers attorney
made answer as follows. Sir, I would have thought that you,
who have come from London, and professes to be a doctor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
law, should know better things; know ye not, that he who
gains the plea, gains his expences as well as the sum, or be
what it will. Yes, it must, and shall be so, said the judges.
Then, said George, This is all I want; which set the whole
court a-laughing, thinking he was a fool and become an
adversary to the poor Woman. Give over your sport, gentlemen,
says George, I have not done yet.&mdash;My lords, judges,
you’ll bear me in this, if the poor Woman made a bargain
with this merchant, and the other two who was with him, for
to keep that pack safely, and to deliver it to none of them,
until they were all three present; now, let that man, who is
here at the time, go and seek the other two, and they shall
have their pack, for she has the pack safe enough; but she
will keep by her first bargain. So I refer to you, judges and
gentlemen, if this poor Woman be not in the right. This
made the judges look one to another, and the whole Court
with one voice, declared the Woman to be in the right, and
ordered the pursuer to go and seek his two companions. No,
no, says George, the poor Woman must first have her expences,
or security for it. Then the judges caused the pursuer to be
arrested at the bar, until the Woman got satisfaction for all
her trouble and expences. So George returned to London
unknown, but for an advocate, whose fame was spread over
all England; which caused many who had law-suits to search
through London for him, but could never find the advocate
who had gained the Widow’s law-plea.</p>

<p>George being one day in the country, and coming thro’ a
village, there came a great big mastiff dog and gripped him
by the leg, until the blood followed his long teeth; George,
with one stroke of his cane came over his eyes, until he fell
down and died upon the spot; ’tis well for thee, says George,
that I killed thee before thou wast brought to justice, for thou
hadst certainly been hanged for what thou hast done, and thy
master severely fined for keeping thee. The owner of the dog
hearing George say so, went off without speaking a word to
George, for fear it had been so.</p>

<p>A country gentleman came one time, and enquired at
George what he thought was the reason he lost every law-suit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
or plea he set his face to; though never so just a claim, the
law went still against him. George asked him, whom he
employed, and he told him, that he was one of the best and
ablest attorneys in England. Yes, says George, I believe he
may be so; but when you go to law again, if you have a mind
to win it, when you give your own attorney a guinea give your
adversary two; for these attornies are much after the nature
of an ass, they won’t speak right, if you do not throw a multitude
of angels before them (meaning pieces of English money,
called angels by name). The gentleman returned in a few
weeks thereafter, and heartily thanked George for his good
advice, for he was not afraid now, but he could gain any plea
he took in hand, just or unjust.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Two drunken fellows one day fell a-beating one another on
the streets of London, which caused a great croud of people to
throng together to see what it was; a taylor being at work up
in a high garret, about three or four stories high, and he hearing
the noise in the street, looked over the window, but could
not well see them; he began to stretch himself, making
a long neck until he fell down out of the window, and
alighted on an old man, who was walking on the street: the
poor taylor was more afraid than hurt, but the man he fell on
died directly. His son caused the taylor to be apprehended,
and tried for the murder of his father; the jury could not
bring it in as wilful murder, neither could they altogether
free the taylor; the jury gave it over to the judges, and the
judges to the king: the king asked George’s advice in
this hard matter. Why, says George, I will give you my
opinion in a minute; you must cause the taylor to stand in the
street, in the same place where the old gentleman was when
he was killed by the taylor, and then let the old gentleman’s
son, the taylor’s adversary, go up to the window from whence
the taylor fell, and jump down, and so kill the taylor, as he did
his father; for I can make no more of it. You see it was a
great mercy for the taylor he had the old gentleman below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
him, else he had been killed on the spot; and that it was the
old gentleman’s lot or misfortune to die there. The taylor’s
adversary hearing this sentence past, he would not venture to
jump over the window, and so the taylor got clear off.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="wee-VI">
<h3 class="lsp2">PART VI.</h3>
</div>

<p>George being one night in company with some English
noblemen in presence of the king, they began to demonstrate
such a fine place as England was, both for beautiful buildings
and fruitful fields: one gentleman said, he knew a place in
England, though they should crop the grass even with the
ground at night, and lay down a crown on it before a hundred
witnesses, against to-morrow you would not know where to find
it. That may seem very strange to some, says George, but it
is no mystery to me, knowing, there would be enough of them
who saw the crown-piece laid down, ready for to come and
take it up before tomorrow. But, says George, I know a place
in the west of Scotland, where, if you’ll tether a horse at night,
against the next morning you will not see him. What a pox
will take him away? says the Englishman. Only such people,
says George, as will take away your crown-piece. O! says
the English nobleman, you know what I mean. Then, says
George, you talk much of towns you have in England, I know
three towns in poor Scotland, for properties you have none
such. Pray, says the gentleman, what are these properties?
Why, says George, I know one town where there is a hundred
bone bridges in it; another town where there are fifty draw-bridges
in it; another town where, tho’ a man commits murder,
treason, or owes never so much money, he runs to that town,
and gets in below a stair, no laws nor justice can harm him.
The nobleman offered immediately to stake a hundred pounds,
that there was no such towns in Europe, besides in Scotland.
They desired George to tell but the names of those towns, for
they would find him out, and know whether lie was a liar or
not. So he told their names, and two men were sent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
Scotland to see them: the first was Duddingstone, near Edinburgh,
where they came and asked for the bone bridges there;
and the people shewed them steps almost between every door,
of the sculls of sheeps-heads, which they used as stepping-stones.
The second was a little country village between Stirling
and Perth, called Auchterardoch,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> where there is a large
strand which runs through the middle of the town, and almost
at every door there is a long stock or stone laid over the
strand, whereupon they pass to their opposite neighbours, and
when a flood came, they would lift their wooden bridges, in
case they should be taken away, and these they called their
draw-bridges. The third was a village called Cambusbarron,
which they pass through from one end to the other, but
there was not a stair in it all; so they returned to England,
and told what manner of bone and draw-bridges they were:
and how there was not a stair in all that place, therefore no
man could run in below it.</p>

<p>As George was on the road travelling to London, the
weather being very rainy and cold, he alighted at an inn to
refresh and warm himself; but the fire-side was so surrounded
with people, he could scarce see the fire: George finding this
to be the case calls to the hostler, and orders to give his horse
at the door half a peck of oysters: You mean oats, Sir: No,
no, says George, it is oysters; and base is that horse, that will
not eat oysters. The people at the fire hearing this, all started
up and ran to the door to see the horse eating oysters: the
moment they left their seats, George took an opportunity to
plant himself before the fire, with a table and a cloth beside
him. In a little they came back again, one by one, saying,
This horse will eat no oysters: Well, well, says George, he is
either too full, or too saucy; so you may bring them in, and I
will eat them myself.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now George being old, and highly advanced in years;
finding his natural strength and state of health daily decaying,
he petitioned king James to let him return to Scotland, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
to visit his friends, and land of his nativity; which he most
willingly granted, (not knowing his design was never to return)
for George had a great desire to resign his soul and breath in
that place of the world, where he received them; and that his
body and bones might be laid among his ancestors, which was
counted a great honour in former ages.</p>

<p>So accordingly George came to the parish of Buchanan, in
the west of Scotland, where he visited all his friends and
relations before his death, during which time the king sent
several messages to him to return in all the haste he could;
but he absolutely refused, telling him, that he would never see
him again: which grieved the king very much to hear him
express himself in that manner. After this, the king sent
him a letter, threatening him very sharply, if he did not appear
in London in the space of twenty days, he would send his lyon
heralds with a party, who would bring him to London, whether
he would or not. Unto which, as an answer, George sent him
a famous letter of admonition, both anent the government of
his kingdoms, and the well being of his soul, which caused the
king to weep very bitterly, when he read it over, with the
following verse:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> A custom not uncommon in Scotland at the present day among the working
classes. Boys, when making a bargain, wet their thumbs and place them on each
other as a token of good faith. Something of this kind may be found in the old
song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">‘Though kith and kin and a’ should revile thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s my thumb I’ll ne’er beguile thee.’</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> In Scotland, in the olden time, forty days were allowed to elapse after the
proclamation of the banns, during which time objectors to the marriage might come
forward. The session clerk had placed in his hands a sum of money as security
for the solemnisation of the marriage; and one had to be found to stand as surety
that the parties would not cohabit before they obtained the sanction of the church.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The ‘providing’ has always been regarded as an important item of the marriage
arrangements. Perhaps the earliest account of the possessions of contracting
parties is to be found in the song, ‘The Wowing of Jok and Jynny,’ supposed to
have been written before the Reformation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> In modern editions of this chap-book the first part ends with the sentence:&mdash;‘So
this disturbed a’ the diversion at Jockey’s bedding, and the sky was beginning
to break in the east before the hurly-burley was over.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The usual name for the village bellman throughout Scotland.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Jockey had been guilty of an offence which, had he lived a century earlier,
might have brought about imprisonment by the civil power, in addition to his
seat on the ‘cock-stool.’ Even about the middle of last century the penalties were
severe, and the disgrace was considered great. Feeling in the matter, however,
seemed to be more prompted by a fear of consequences than by true morality.
Dr. Rogers, in <cite>Scotland Social and Domestic</cite>, p. 311, thus explains the legal position
of presbyteries and kirk-sessions in regard to such matters&mdash;‘At the Reformation,
Presbyterian judicatories proceeded to occupy the position of Consistory
Courts. They took cognisance of offences precisely similar, with the exception
of such as “speaking evil of saints” and “the non-payment of offerings,” or
those which bore direct reference to the Catholic faith. Under the Presbyterian
system, the kirk-session exercised the functions of the Archdeacon’s Commissary,
and Presbyterian Synods and the General Assembly formed an appellate jurisdiction
similar to that which was exercised by the Archdeacons and Bishops and the
Archbishops of St. Andrews.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The stool was placed in front of the pulpit, in full view of the congregation.
In some parishes the culprits were allowed to sit, but in most cases they had to
stand.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The ‘sacken sark’ had a variety of names, such as ‘the harden gown,’ ‘the
sack gown,’ ‘the harn gown,’ and ‘the linen.’ Each parish was supposed to
have one of these habits: and in 1655 the sum of £4 4 6 Scots was expended by
the kirk-session of Lesmahagow in the purchase of one. A specimen of the ‘sacken
sark’ may be seen in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> A fine paid to the Kirk-Session, who distributed it, with the other moneys in
their possession, among the poor of the parish. See the <a href="#amh-II">second part</a> of <cite>The History
of Buckhaven</cite>, where the culprit is made to pay ‘four pound and a groat,’ probably
Scots money, equal to about seven shillings sterling.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> The following paragraph concludes the second part in modern editions:&mdash;‘Now
Jockey and his mither went into the little byre and held a private meeting, nane
present but auld Bruckie and the twa Brutes, the bits of couties, that she might
give him counsel how to behave when he appeared before Mess John, to answer
for his bastard; which concludes the third and last part.’ The ‘third and last
part’ in these editions, however, fails to carry the story to its proper issue, and only
gives a very summary account of Jockey on the cutty-stool.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Ante-nuptial fornication&mdash;‘on the terms of marriage’&mdash;was lamentably common,
but in such cases the law of the church, while duly put in force, was
considerably relaxed in its severity, if marriage followed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> The civil authorities were frequently called upon to give effect to church censures.
In the seventeenth century sentence of excommunication practically carried
with it all the pains of civil outlawry; but in 1690 an Act of the Estates abrogated
the civil consequences of the sentence.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Milled oats, or oats with the husks taken off.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> This is rather an original account of the rise and progress of the black-stool:
but it would be difficult to say how far history supports it. In a chap-book
printed in 1776 under the title of ‘An Account of the General Assembly’s Invention
for the final Extirpation of the Black-stool of Repentance and the Sackcloth
Gown out of the Kirk of Scotland: proposing a new and easy method of punishing
sporting ladies,’ a similar account is given of the stool.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> The Church rule on the point here brought out by Mess John may be illustrated
by an enactment passed by the Kirk Session of Glasgow in 1591, which
bore that those desirous of entering the conjugal state had to repeat the ten
commandments, the articles of faith, and the Lord’s prayer. If the candidates
could not pass the examination they were declared unworthy of being joined in
marriage, and were liable to censure. A few days after this decree had been
issued, the Session prohibited a marriage until the bridegroom had learned his
task. The Presbytery of Glasgow, in 1594, prohibited a marriage because the
bridegroom was ‘in greit debt.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Suspension from church privileges for a time, until they showed signs of
repentance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> The beginning of the New Year, or Yule, festivities.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> A superstition long prevalent, and scarcely yet eradicated in some parts of
Scotland. The mother was not safe from the power of fairies until she had been
‘kirk’t,’ and the child, until baptised, was in danger of being carried away by
them, a changeling being substituted in its stead. Jockey’s mother seems to have
had a touch of the same superstition when she spoke of the difference between a
child and a dog&mdash;‘A dog is a brute beast, an’ a wean is a christen’d creature.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> The custom in Scotland was to have a number of the neighbours along with
the members of the family.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Young women, besides providing their bridal clothes before their marriage,
frequently spun their winding sheet immediately after that event. Flora Macdonald
carried about with her, throughout all her wanderings after her liberation
in 1747, the sheet in which Prince Charles had lain at Kingsburgh’s house in
Skye, with the intention that it should be her shroud. And so it was.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> These were not the days of hearses. The common people never thought of a
carriage, and, indeed, it was only at the funerals of the nobility that hearses
were to be seen. Usually the coffin was taken to the grave on wooden bars,
called ‘spaiks,’ borne by the mourners, who, if the journey were long, relieved each
other.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> The eating and drinking long prevalent at funerals was something marvellous,
and on more than one occasion it is recorded that mourners separated in confusion
and ill-feeling. At the funeral of Sir Hugh Campbell of Calder, in March,
1716, nearly £70 sterling were spent in meat and drink alone, and when the
difference in the value of money is taken into consideration the sum must
appear large. In 1704, Lord Whitelaw, a Senator of the College of Justice, was
buried at the expense of £5189 Scots, or £432 8s. 4d. sterling, which meant more
than two years’ salary as a judge.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> At births it was customary&mdash;and still is under a modified form&mdash;to hand round
‘blythe-meat’ to all visitors.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> Another name for the stool of repentance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> A colloquialism. The meaning is&mdash;‘You must not kiss any woman <em>other
than</em> your own wife.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> A witticism for whitings or haddocks. Dunbar has from an early period been
one of the leading ports on the east coast fishing grounds.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> It would be difficult to say how the herring caught in Loch Fyne came to be
called ‘Glasgow Magistrates.’ The name is still applied to them.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> One way of putting an old Scottish proverb. Henderson’s reading of it is:&mdash;‘There
ne’er was a silly Jockey but what there was a silly Jenny.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> In some modern editions the word ‘jaw’ is inserted instead of ‘jamf,’ or, as
it is sometimes spelled ‘jamph.’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> In Morren’s edition of this chap-book, published in Edinburgh in the early
years of the present century, the word here used is ‘keckling,’ meaning to laugh,
or, more properly, to ‘smirk.’ ‘Keckling’ seems the more likely word.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Another reading of the old saying&mdash;‘The deil catch the hindmost.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> This can hardly be taken literally. Possibly what is meant is ‘powsee,’ a small
fresh haddock.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> In some later editions the description of Sawny is made more complete by the
insertion, in this place, of the following:&mdash;‘and an auld creeshy hat, mair like a
fryingpan than any thing else.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> Taverns and eating-houses were frequently, in east-coast towns, on the ‘sunk-flat,’
access to them being gained by a flight of steps down from the foot-pavement.
Several such shops may still be seen in the old town of Edinburgh, in the vicinity
of the High Street and Canongate.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> The women about fishing communities differed, and do still, from their sisters
further inland, regarding house-work, or ‘husband-work.’ Matty’s opinion is a
fair reflection of the ideas of her class. A further expression is given to this feeling
in <cite>The History of Buckhaven</cite>, where Graham, describing the people about
whom he was writing, says:&mdash;‘They kept but little communication with the
country people, for a farmer, in those days, thought his daughter cast awa if she
married one of the fishers in Bucky-harbour, and Witty Eppie the ale-wife wad a
sworn, be go’ laddie, I wad rather see my boat and a’ my three sons upset against
the Bass, or I saw are o’ them married on a muck-a-byre’s daughter, a wheen
useles taupies that can do naething but rive at a tow rock [spin], and cut corn;
they can neither bait a hook nor red a line, hook sandles nor gather periwinkles.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> An old stocking leg, in which it was the custom of old women to sew up
whatever savings they might have been able to make, and generally hidden away
in some odd corner. Some of these ‘hoggers’ have been known to be very substantial.
Even yet, now that banks are everywhere, the simile is kept up, though
the stocking leg has fallen into disuse for banking purposes. Some persons speak
about ‘laying by for a sair fit.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> The beginning of the paragraph reads this way in Morren’s edition:&mdash;‘On
this Sawny paid their spout and parted.’ That seems the more likely way of it,
for later on Sawny speaks of courting being ‘a curst wark and <em>costly</em>.’</p>

of her native country, further exhibits her belief in witchcraft. In this she was
not singular. After a long crusade against witches, the minds of the better educated
classes became somewhat enlightened on the subject, and Parliament, in 1735,
revoked the penal statutes against sorcery. Many of the ministers regarded this act
as a national sin, and said it was contrary to the express law of God. John
Wesley, it may be remembered, said that to give up belief in witchcraft was, in
effect, giving up the Bible.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> Penny weddings have been immortalised by Semple of Beltrees in his song
<cite>The Blythsome Bridal</cite>. Originally, pennies were contributed by those present,
and any overplus, after providing for the wedding feast, went towards assisting
the young couple in their furnishing. Latterly, the neighbours sent in eatables of
various kinds, the bride’s friends only preparing one dish, the ‘bride’s pie,’ the
equivalent to the ‘bride’s-cake’ of modern days. As with the cake, so with the
pie, every one present received a piece. The marriage ceremony was generally
celebrated at the manse, and the wedding festivities took place in the bride’s house.
These festivities some times lasted several days&mdash;see, for example, Ramsay’s addition
to <cite>Christ’s Kirk on the Green</cite>, by James I.&mdash;and were productive of serious
irregularities. Ultimately the Church made an effort to regulate them, but with
little effect.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> That is, by failing to pay the Kirk dues. There was the money for the
‘cries,’ or banns, which was in itself a respectable sum, and a variety of other
payments, which made marriage an expensive affair. The minister was given a
small acknowledgment for his services; but now-a-days it is usual, instead, to
make a present of a satin hat, a pair of gloves, a comforter, or such like.</p>

would have little chance of getting such a complete set out after, as before, marriage.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> The story of the chase after the ‘poor dominie’ is omitted in Morren’s edition,
but the following new matter is inserted in its stead:&mdash;‘Tom came running home
all besmear’d with blood, at the sight whereof his father cry’d, what’s the matter
Tom? To which he made no answer: searching him, the trick was discovered
and poor Tom received a severe chastisment. Tom, to be revenged on his father,
rose in the night time and broke the fauld and let out the cattle amongst his
father’s corn, and goes to bed again, this he did unperceived. Next morning, the
neighbours observing the cattle lying amongst the corn, came running, and told
his father how they had destroyed all his victual, for they had eat till they had like
to burst. All the time Tom lay in his bed, and his father much vexed at his laziness,
and told him that he would never have the benefit of more schooling as his
master had so many grievious complaints against him; at which Tom rejoiced
within himself as he did not value learning, nor put it in balance with his designed
tricks; Tom then scampered away, and meeting with an egg cadger coming to
Edinburgh, desired him to alight from his horse, and he would give him a dram
at the Fallow kirk, at which, the poor man was glad, and went in with him.
Tom called for two drams and bade the cadger drink hearty, in the mean time
Tom slips out and mounts the cadger’s horse, and puts a foot in each creel, and
made the eggs all caddle, and then he dismounted and ran; so that the poor cadger
lost his eggs, and had the drams to pay for.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> In Morren’s edition this story is told in a very different way. As has already
been explained, the first and second parts in that edition are run into one, and
the following paragraph immediately succeeds the story told in the preceding
note:&mdash;‘Tom was always playing tricks to his grandmother, as he knew she was
rich, and would part with nothing to him; he lays in wait one night, and conceals
himself in a corner until all was at rest, Tom rises and takes the keys of a drawer,
and slips out about forty shillings, and slips off to Dalkeith on a Thursday where
his grandmother’s servant girl came that day. Tom was spending largely, and the
girl who knew that Tom had no money, came home and told his grandmother
that Tom had taken away her money, this so enraged him, that he lashed her
buttocks with his wheep in so unmerciful a manner, that what with the smart and
shame together she had not the least inclination to sleep the remaining part of the
day.’ The narrative then proceeds:&mdash;‘Tom being grown up to the years and age
of a man,’ etc.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> It was customary among country folks, and is so still in some districts of Scotland,
to kill a fat animal at Martinmas of each year, and salt it for the winter’s
provision. Even people in urban districts, though they had not a cow nor an ox,
had a pig which they had been fattening for a year, and which was then considered
ready for the sacrifice. Hence the term ‘winter mairt.’ The word ‘mairt,’ or
‘mart,’ ultimately came to denote a person who lived in ease and prosperity.</p>

as if there had been no break. The folios run right through the three numbers,
the whole chap-book occupying twenty-four pages.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> The old jail in the Canongate of Edinburgh is still an object of interest.
Jailers in the past occupied a very different position from what they do now.
They acted more in the capacity of taverners than their brethren of the present
day. In English plays and novels of last century their position is fully shown;
and in the same period a similar state of matters existed in Scotland. In Glasgow,
after the erection of the Tolbooth at the Cross, in 1627, the jailer was given a yearly
salary of 40 merks (£2 4s. 5½ sterling), and he was to receive from every burgess
or inhabitant of the city who should be committed to his care 2s. Scots (2d. sterling)
for entry and booking fee, and the same sum for every twenty-four hours during
which the person should be incarcerated. Outsiders, however, had double fees to
pay their host. On account of ‘having only thiefes and lounes as prisoners,’ and
getting no profit from them, the jailer of 1661 received from the Town Council of
Glasgow a grant of £20 Scots (£1 13s. 4d. sterling). The Privy Council Records
show that in 1696 the keeper of Canongate Tolbooth was allowed 2s. Scots per
night, with one penny sterling for the servants&mdash;in all 3d. sterling&mdash;for every recruit
he kept.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[61]</a> This clause is added in some modern undated editions:&mdash;‘and so Tom gained

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> The old woman, by her remark about witchcraft and her belief in Tom’s proposal,
discovers the presence of superstitions in her mind. The belief in witchcraft
was then in a transition stage. Many people firmly believed in it; others were
doubtful; while not a few, like Tom, played the rogue on the strength of the
superstition in others. It is more than probable that the tricks of such as Lothian
Tom did more to enlighten the people than anything else. As for the clergy,
they were a hindrance, and rather fostered the belief in witchcraft.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> This concludes the second number. The third number, like the others, had a

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> The modern undated Glasgow editions end here with the words:&mdash;‘for it is

part five, so that in them there are only five parts. In the Stirling (1801) edition,
however, the story is carried on to the end of the scene with the lawyer.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> It was quite a common conclusion of a law-suit for the lawyer and his client
to ‘drink a bottle’ or even get ‘fou’ together, especially if they were on the
winning side. Consultations were generally held in some tavern in the vicinity of
the court, and the whole aspect of a case was discussed under the stimulating influence
of a ‘tappit hen.’ Sir Walter Scott in the text and notes to <cite>Guy Mannering</cite>
gives a most interesting account of the convivial habits of the Scottish bar during
last century.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> Chapmen were looked upon by the common people as characters whose disinclination
to work led them into a lazy life. Their services to the community
were acknowledged, but only under a protest that had they not been ‘haters of
hard work’ they could not have gone into the business. This feeling, however,
arose chiefly from the popular idea, which still finds expression, that nothing can
be called work except manual labour.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> Before the introduction of the present complex Poor Law system, each parish
in Scotland, through its kirk session, gave relief to its own poor. The strictness
of the authorities passed into a proverb. Many parishes had barrows on which
the infirm poor not belonging to them were wheeled outside the boundaries and left
to do for themselves as best they could. We have read of a case in which relief
was refused to a sickly stranger, and the village joiner was employed to make a
barrow for the person’s removal. Before the work was done the poor unfortunate
had died.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">[80]</a> In Morren’s edition there is here added:&mdash;‘and give us a proper drubbing.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">[81]</a> Possibly this practice&mdash;for the frequency with which it is mentioned in this
and other chap-books indicates that it was so&mdash;may have given rise to the proverbial
expression still common in Scotland:&mdash;‘I’ll tak a sup out your cog for that,’
used when a person wishes to convey a vague threat.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> The suggestion from this passage seems to be that the lads did not sleep in
the house, but in a ‘bothy’ in the vicinity. The arrangement in many farm houses
in some parts of Scotland is&mdash;and it was much more common a century ago&mdash;that
the maid servants slept in the house, while the men were accommodated in an out-house.
During harvesting operations, shearers from a distance lived in a wooden
‘bothy’ erected on the farm. The system was not quite satisfactory, and often
gave rise to serious irregularities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="label">[83]</a> Now-a-days it may seem strange that John Cheap, after his first night’s experience
in the stye, should have cared to have had it a second time. Travelling
on Sunday, however, was a thing not to be thought of a century ago. It was
doubtful, even, if a hen did not break the commandment by laying an egg on the
Sabbath. Dean Ramsay tells the story of a Highlander who gave the following
instance in support of the ‘God-fearin’’ character of the people of the village in
which he resided:&mdash;‘Last Sabbath, just as the kirk was skailin’, there was a
drover chield frae Dumfries comin’ along the road whustlin’, an’ lookin’ as happy
as if it was ta muddle o’ the week; well, sir, our laads is a God-fearin’ set o’ laads,
an’ they were just comin’ out o’ the kirk&mdash;’od they yokit upon him, an’ a’most
killed him.’ A similar fate might have befallen John Cheap had he travelled for
a change of lodgings. Certainly he would have been taken before the Session
and rebuked.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> Our Lord’s miracle of the casting out the legion of the devils from the man
amongst the tombs, and their subsequent entrance into a herd of swine, seems to
have made a strong impression on the Scottish mind. John Cheap’s remarks on
the subject are fairly representative of the ideas of many country people in Scotland
even of the present day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> Disrespect for all sanitary considerations was for centuries an unfortunate
feature in Scotland, and was the main cause of the frequent plagues&mdash;or ‘visitations’
as they were piously termed&mdash;which depopulated the country and crippled
its resources. Refuse of all sorts was thrown into the ‘midden-dub’ in front of
the door of each house. In the Trongate of Glasgow, in 1655, the gutters had
become so blocked up that the inhabitants had to place stepping stones in them
before they could obtain access to their houses. In Edinburgh, a century later,
ashes, foul water, etc., were thrown over the windows at night, the only warning
the belated pedestrian received being the melodious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardez l’eau</i>; and happy was
he if he escaped.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> The ‘evil eye’ was a most terrible thing, according to Scottish superstition;
and a variety of ‘freits’ or charms were had recourse to as shields against it. In
the <cite>Justiciary Records</cite>, of 1661, it is stated that Beatrix Leslie entered the house
of one Agnes Young ‘in ane great fury and anger, and pluckt away a pock belonging
to her, which the said Agnes had in keiping, without speaking ane word
to her, bot gieving her ane <em>terrible look</em>; and that same verry night, the said
William Young [her husband] awakened out of his sleep, in a great affrightment
and sweat, crying out, that she with a number of catts wer devouring him.’ Many
similar instances are on record. Of course they were simply due to perverted
imagination.</p>

his board and lodging, with a small money payment. Sometimes a week’s work
might be given the tailor in this way, when the ‘callans,’ as well as their father,
were in need of new clothes. When the goodwife and her daughters were similarly
situated, the dressmaker was brought in on the same principle. This custom is
not yet dead; though it is fast disappearing.</p>

be no Sabbath breaking. The old Jewish idea of a ‘Sabbath-day’s’ journey was
kept to the letter, and no one was allowed to walk on the streets except going to
or coming from the church. Any person found taking a walk ran the risk of being
taken to the guard-house by the ‘civileers,’ who were inquisitors appointed conjointly
by the Town Council and the kirk session. The average Scotsman would
rather let his crops go to ruin than take them in on a fine Sabbath.</p>

true meaning:&mdash;‘Mercheta is the older form of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritagium</i> or marriage-tax, in
the charters of Robert I., and not only the servile class, but the free tenants also
paid a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritagium</i> on the marriage of their daughters.... Some learning has

an ancient seignorial right&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus primae noctis</i>. I have not looked
carefully into the French authorities; but I think there is no evidence of a custom
so odious existing in England; and in Scotland, I venture to say that there is
nothing to ground a suspicion of such a right. The merchet of women with us
was simply the tax paid by the different classes of bondmen and tenants and
vassals, when they gave their daughters in marriage, and thus deprived the lord of
their services, to which he was entitled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure sanguinis</i>.’ The reader may also find
the matter very learnedly discussed in the appendix to Lord Hailes’ <cite>Annals of

think it was a mean, low-priced business for Satan to take up with; below the
very Devil: below his dignity as an angelic, though condemned creature; below
him even as a Devil, to go to talk to a parcel of ugly, deformed, spightful,

amongst other things Maggy told Janet, that although she was now above a

be obliged to use some methods and enticements to make the young men fall in
love wi’ her. Upon which, Janet gave her the following witty advice.’</p>

<p>The dialogue then proceeds as given in the edition re-produced in these pages.

as opposed to the old feudal system of raising an army. It would be difficult
to account for this feeling, but it is still the fact that even now service in the
army is regarded as the last resource of a respectable tradesman or countryman.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="label">[168]</a> A custom which has not yet fallen into disuetude in Irish communities. The
popular idea of the use of these articles is simply that the brogues are for the
accommodation of the dead man on his journey heaven-wards; the candle to light
him on the way; the ‘good hard-headed old hammer’ to raise St. Peter, the
venerable porter at the celestial gate; and the money is to pay for tolls. To many
persons this explanation may smack somewhat of irreverence, but we are not aware
of any more satisfactory explanation of the custom. Divested of its ‘bulls,’ the
narrative of Teague is a fair outline of the proceedings at an Irish funeral.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171" class="label">[171]</a> The inhabitants of Buck-haven have always been acknowledged to be a
peculiar people. An account of their origin is to the effect that they are the
descendants of the crew of a ship from the Netherlands, which stranded on the
coast of Fifeshire in reign of James IV. The village of Buckie, mentioned in the
text, is on the Moray Firth, in the parish of Ruthven, county of Banff.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_177" href="#FNanchor_177" class="label">[177]</a> The people of Buckhaven seem to have been free from the old superstition
regarding the horse-shoe charm. A horse-shoe nailed to a stable door kept the
four-footed inmates free from the power of ‘uncanny’ beings. The custom still
lingers in the country, but it is due more to use and wont than any active belief in
its virtues.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_179" href="#FNanchor_179" class="label">[179]</a> Christening was looked upon by the people of Scotland as almost necessary to
salvation. That doctrine held by a large section of the Christian church, was here
largely mingled with superstition, and the powers of evil were thought to have a
malign influence on the body and soul of an unchristened person. The popular
ideas on the subject may be found fairly well brought out at p. 34 of the present
volume.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> In the olden times the lord and lady moved out and in among their people,
and took an active interest in their every day concerns. This intercourse was
generally productive of good, and the relationship between a superior and his
vassals or tenants was of the most pleasant kind.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> This and other names in the chap-book give examples of the need there was
in a community, consisting really of one large family, with the same surname
common to almost all, for nicknames to distinguish between several persons who
also bore the same Christian name. A more interesting account of such a circumstance
is given by Cosmo Innes, in his work on <cite>Some Scottish Surnames</cite>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> The coarse language here used is in no way an exaggerated account of what
may have actually occurred at the period with which the author is dealing. Great
laxity of morals and of speech prevailed; but vice, it must also be stated, came
more to the surface than now. The people were uncultivated, and did not seek to
cast a veil of prudery over their failings, however much these were to be reprobated.
Swearing was then considered fashionable among the ladies of England:
what could be expected from the peasantry of Scotland?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="label">[187]</a> Belief in dreams and omens was almost universal, and was fostered by the
chap dream-books, whose modern successors may be found in <cite>Napoleon’s Book
of fate</cite>, etc.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="label">[188]</a> The foregoing paragraph was thus given in the abridged editions:&mdash;‘There
was a custom in Bucky harbour, when they got a hearty drink, that they went
down to dance among the boats, two or three of the oldest went into a boat to see
the rest dance, and when they admitted a burgher, there was always a dance.
One day they admitted gly’d Rob, who was a warlock, and made them all stop
their dancing, for which he was carried before wise Willie to answer for that, for
which he was banished to the isle of May, to carry coals to the Light House.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="label">[189]</a> Willy Thomson must have been guilty of some serious offence, when he was
condemned to slavery. In comparatively recent times actual property in the persons
who worked in coal-mines in Scotland was to be found, and the old records bear
ample testimony to the existence of serfdom, and to the punishment of subjection
to slavery being considered a part of the judicial system of the country.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> The third of May, when many superstitious observances were made. The
first of May was Beltane, and has been traced to the fire-worship of the ancient
Caledonians. Rood-day superstitions, however, were of more recent origin. Great
precautions were taken against the power of witches and fairies, and if these should
be neglected ill-luck would follow. Jamieson, in his <cite>Dictionary of the Scottish
Language</cite>, under the word ‘Rude-day,’ gives a most interesting account of the
ceremonies gone through on the yearly return of the festival.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="label">[191]</a> The ‘mauken,’ or hare seems to have occupied a most important position in the
folk-lore of all countries, but notably of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott, in his work
on <cite>Demonology and Witchcraft</cite>, tells how Isobel Gowdie, one of the witches of
Auldern, disguised herself as a hare and after being hunted by hounds for some
time, took refuge in a house where she found opportunity to say the disenchanting
rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">‘Hare, Hare, God send thee care!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am in a hare’s likeness now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I shall be woman even now&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hare, hare, God send thee care:’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is her own story. A most valuable and interesting article, on ‘The Hare
in Folk-Lore’ was contributed to a recent number of the <cite>Folk-Lore Journal</cite> by
Mr. William George Black, F.S.A. Scot., and should be consulted by those who
wish to know more about this subject.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="label">[192]</a> The statement contained in the text gives an excellent account of what was
believed to be the attributes of the water-kelpie. In many old ballads references,
such as the following, may be found:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">‘The bonnie gray mare did sweat for fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For she heard the water-kelpie roaring.’</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="label">[193]</a> Frequent reference has been made to the supposed power of fairies over unchristened
children and their mothers. ‘Changelings’ were greatly feared. If a
child developed a strong and uncontrollable temper there arose a suspicion that it
was a ‘changeling,’ the meaning being that the fairies had slipped away the
mother’s own child and substituted a little fiend in human form in its stead. It
was believed that the best way to set the suspicion at rest was to submit the little
unfortunate to the test of the fire. We have not, however, noticed any case
where the test was actually carried out.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> The ‘mauken’s fit’ was particularly feared by the fishers on the east-coast of
Scotland. Very recently, and it may be so still, it was sufficient to raise the ire
of a fisher woman to wish she had a hare’s foot in her creel. The wish was
regarded as equivalent to a malediction.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> That is, a maker of shallow baskets such as are used by fishers for carrying
their fish.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="label">[196]</a> ‘Maids of honour,’ instead of ‘Maries,’ in the more recent editions. Jamieson,
under the word ‘Maries,’ says:&mdash;‘The designation given to the maids of honour in
Scotland.... This Queen [Mary Stuart] had four maids of honour, all of the
name of <em>Mary</em>. There were Mary Livingston, Mary Fleming&mdash;Seaton, and&mdash;Beaton.
Hence it has been supposed, that the name passed into a general denomination
for female attendants.... From analogy, I am much inclined to
think that the term is far more ancient than the period referred to. For we learn
from Lye [<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum</cite>], that the O. E. [Old
English] called the queen’s maids, the <em>Queen’s Meys</em>. Hence it is highly probable
that our term <em>Marie</em> is an official designation, and allied to Isl. [Icelandic] <em>maer</em>,
a maid, a virgin.... Thus the <em>Queen’s Maries</em>, a phrase still common among
the vulgar, may be exactly synonymous with the <em>Queen’s Maids</em>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[197]</a> This story is not given in Randall’s edition; but it has been inserted here from
the Falkirk 1799 edition. A similar story is told of ‘Tom Tram,’ an English
chap-book hero, and of Sancho Panza, in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198" class="label">[198]</a> In the later editions the dispute is said to have arisen about ‘education,’ not
‘religion,’ and it is stated of George that ‘he blanked the bishop remarkably.’
While this story undoubtedly presents an exaggerated picture of the educational
virtues of Scotland, it must be remembered that owing to the system of parochial
schools instituted by Knox the lower classes in Scotland had facilities for instruction,
especially in the classics, which the otherwise more favoured English people
did not possess.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> A similar story will be found in Bacon’s <cite>Apothegms</cite>. See <cite>Essays and Historical
Works</cite>, Bohn’s edition, p. 189.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_200" href="#FNanchor_200" class="label">[200]</a> Properly ‘Kinbot.’ The law or custom is much older than the reign of James
VI., as the story here indicates. Jamieson derives the word from Anglo-Saxon
<em>cin</em>, kindred, and <em>bot</em>, compensation. The present editor, in his <cite>History of Glasgow</cite>,
p. 114, gives an account of an interesting case which occurred in Glasgow in the
sixteenth century.</p>

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
